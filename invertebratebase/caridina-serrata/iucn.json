It is however acknowledged that the species inhabits a very small area (EOO far less than 100 km<sup>2</sup>) and given that its entire known distribution is within a major urban conglomeration, the species is considered to be Near Threatened (close to meeting VU D2).","assessor":"De Grave, S. & Klotz, W.","evaluator":"Cumberlidge, N. & Smith, K."}]
