{"wiki":["Orconectes limosus, Eastern Crayfish, Or Delcore Crayfish is a species of crayfish in the family Cambaridae. It is native to the east coast of North America, from Maine to the lower James River, Virginia, but has also been introduced to Europe.[2] It is unusual in that it lives in silty streams, rather than the clear water usually preferred by crayfish.[3] Like Pacifastacus leniusculus, another invasive North American crayfish, O. limosus carries crayfish plague and is a threat to native crayfish. [4]","O. limosus was introduced to Germany in 1890, and has since spread across much of Northern Europe, recently reaching the United Kingdom.[4] It has also spread southwards as far as the Danube in Serbia.[5]","Orconectes limosus can reproduce sexually or by parthenogenesis.[6] Lobsters and Crayfish are decapods meaning that they have 10 legs. 2 of them are claws. These Crayfish live on the bottom of the freshwater pools, such as lakes, ponds and swamps. They prefer flat, sandy, and rocky floors. They are also found outside the water on beaches or lawns near the pool of water. They use rocks to make burrows while in the water. This is a very common species of cray, especially on Northeast United States, and Southeast Canada.","External links"],"create_time":1427249038.59969}
