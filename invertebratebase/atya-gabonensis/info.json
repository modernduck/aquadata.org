{"wiki":["Atya gabonensis (vampire shrimp) is a species of freshwater shrimp from West Africa and South America. It is an omnivorous filter feeder that uses feather-like claspers to filter particles from the water. It can grow to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm).","Distribution","Atya gabonensis is found in West Africa, from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in South America from Venezuela to Brazil.[2]","In aquaria","Despite their predatory-sounding name, they are a non-aggressive species that does well in community tanks that have areas to hide during the molting process. Another requirement is a moderate to strong current where the shrimp can sit and catch food. A pH of 6.5\u20137.8 is acceptable as well as temperatures of 74\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C). As with most invertebrates they are very susceptible to medications used to treat many fish diseases, with copper being deadly. Also ammonia and nitrite poisoning are possible.[3]","Coloring of this species can vary from a creamy white to an almost rusty brown, and also a deep blue. It is believed that the water conditions will affect coloring and harder water causes the blue morph. These shrimp have been known to change coloring several times in the same year.[3]","External links"],"create_time":1427248995.66516}
