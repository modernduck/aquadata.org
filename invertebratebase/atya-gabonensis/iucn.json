However the South American populations may pertain to&#160;<em>Atya scabra</em> (Mantelatto, F.L. pers. comm. 2012) and no recent records are known in South America. It occurs in larger lowland rivers, often with fast currents and on a rocky substrate. This is considered a widespread species with no known major threats, as such it is considered as Least Concern. Even if the South American populations are excluded, the species would still qualify as Least Concern.","assessor":"De Grave, S. & Mantellato, F.","evaluator":"Cumberlidge, N. & Smith, K."}]
