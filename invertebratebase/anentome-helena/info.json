{"wiki":["Clea helena is a species of freshwater snail with an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Buccinidae, the true whelks, most of which are marine.[2][3]","Distribution","This species occurs throughout southeast Asia, especially in Malaysia, Thailand and in Lake Toba on the Indonesian island Sumatra.[4][5]","Feeding habits","Like all snails in the clade Neogastropoda, this species is carnivorous. It feeds on worms and gastropods, and is often known as the \"assassin snail\" for its habit of eating other snails. These snails will often feed on larger snails, often burying themselves and ambushing their prey.[3]","In the aquarium they are very good at hunting down and eating small problem snails that over time take over a tank and appear, generally, when new aquatic plants are purchased. They will also eat high protein foods such as algae wafers and certain sinking food pellets.","Characteristics","This snail will typically grow between 2\u20133\" in size depending on food sources, usually smaller in the aquarium. The shell, which is conical in shape consists of dark brown and yellowish tan bands, leading to some people to refer to this snail as \"The Bumble Bee Snail\", a name also applied to the marine snail Engina mendicaria. Many aquarists consider this to be one of the more attractive snails available to the hobby.","Reproduction","Clea helena consists of defined male and female individuals which are not capable of sex change. Currently, it is not known how to identify which is male and which is female. Both male and female seem to be the same size and shape. When a male and female mate, they lock together for eight to twelve hours. The female lays several single eggs which are square in shape with a yellow sack. Some eggs do not reach maturity, however fertile eggs usually hatch within a few days, depending on the mineral qualities of the surrounding water.","External links"],"create_time":1427248991.24304}
