Crayfish are characterized by a joined head and thorax, and a segmented body.  In the case of the species <span class=\"taxon-name\">Procambarus clarkii</span>, the body is a very dark red color, with a wedge-shaped black stripe on the abdomen.  Crayfish have a sharp snout and moveable eyes on their heads.  Like all arthropods, crayfish have a thin but tough exoskeleton that they shed during development.  Crayfish have 5 pairs of walking legs, the first of which are large pinchers used for feeding.  On the red swamp crayfish, the pinchers tend to be narrow and long.  They have long antennae with sensory organs on them.  This along with appendages used for feeding, are characteristic of the subphylum Mandibulata.  There are also five pairs of smaller appendages called swimmerets on the abdomen. The carapace of this species, located on the dorsal side, are not separated by a space.  The most posterior pair of appendages are called uropods.  Uropods are flat, broad extentions that surround the telson, which is the last abdominal segment.  Uropods are also used for swimming (Safra, et al 1999; McDonald 1996; Vodopich and Moore 1999; Barnes 1974).</p><p><strong>Other Physical Features: </strong> ectothermic ; bilateral symmetry </p>","agents":[{"full_name":"Stephanie Fabritius, Southwestern University","homepage":"","role":"editor"},{"full_name":"Julia Rogers, Southwestern University","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Animal Diversity Web","homepage":"http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"15c0e43fe3ba466d5bb96ecc69d27299","dataObjectVersionID":28859862,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","mimeType":"text/html","title":"National Distribution","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<h5>United States</h5><p><strong>Origin</strong>: Native</p><p><strong>Regularity</strong>: Regularly occurring</p><p><strong>Currently</strong>: Present</p><p><strong>Confidence</strong>: Confident</p><p><strong>Type of Residency</strong>: Year-round</p>","agents":[{"full_name":"NatureServe","homepage":"http://www.natureserve.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"b364ae3da067983e6a46db1333c908c2","dataObjectVersionID":28859861,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","mimeType":"text/html","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<p><strong>Global Range</strong>: (200,000-2,500,000 square km (about 80,000-1,000,000 square miles)) Native range extends from the Mississippi-Ohio confluence down the Mississippi River floodplain to Louisiana, and along the Gulf coastal Plain southwest to Alabama, to the Rio Grande basin in south New Mexico and north Mexico.

Recently it was found at a single in the Catawba River in North Carolina (Alderman, 2005). It has been introduced to all North Carolina river basins in the Piedmont Plateau and Coastal Plain (Cooper and Armstrong, 2007; Simmons and Fraley, 2010). It has been introduced in a variety of aquatic habitats in lentic areas in South Carolina across much of the state (Eversole and Jones, 2004).In Georgia, it has been introduced into a single stream in downtown Athens and a highly disturbed urban stream in Gwinnett Co. and an urban stream in the Etowah River system (Skelton, 2010).  In the Cumberland Plateau it occurs from introductions in the Black Warrior River system in Jefferson Co., Alabama. (Bouchard, 1974). In Kentucky, it has a distribution almost identical to <i>Procambarus viaeviridis</i>; known from the floodplains of the extreme lower Tennessee, lower Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers and from tributaries of the Mississippi River in the extreme western portion of the state (Taylor and Schuster, 2004). In Indiana, it was collected in 2000 from Lake Michigan in Indiana and it has spread into the West Branch of the Grand Calamet River (Simon, 2001) and more recently in East Branch Calumet River in Lake Co. (Simon et al., 2005). In Ohio, it was introduced in the western end of Sandusky Bay, a fish hatchery at Denison University, and the Grand River upstream of Harpersfield Dam (Thoma and Jezerinac, 2000).  In Missouri, it occurs widely in the Lowland Faunal Region (Pflieger, 1996). In Illinois it is known from lowland habitats in the extreme southern Illinois counties of Alexander, Jackson, massac, Pope, Pulaski, and Union (Page, 1985) and recently the North branch Chicago River in Chicago, Cook Co.; hundreds of km north (Taylor and Tucker, 2005). In Alabama, it is known from the Tennessee, Mobile, Black Warrior, Cahaba, Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Escambia River systems (Schuster and Taylor, 2004) as well as Alabama, Pascagoula, and Tombigbee drainages (Schuster et al., 2008).  In Texas, the natural range is throughout the eastern portion along the coastal plain and upstream within rivers thatr flow from the Edwards Plateau into the Gulf (Johnson and Johnson, 2008). This species has been documented in Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, Mexico (Dinger et al., 2005).  </p>","agents":[{"full_name":"NatureServe","homepage":"http://www.natureserve.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"d62b59638f2d285afc67dfd233b4acc1","dataObjectVersionID":28859856,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#PopulationBiology","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Global Abundance","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<p>>1,000,000 individuals</p>","agents":[{"full_name":"NatureServe","homepage":"http://www.natureserve.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"ff77ed5b416b2f79c9bccfa28f42436f","dataObjectVersionID":28859855,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus","mimeType":"text/html","title":"National NatureServe Conservation Status","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<h5>United States</h5><p><strong>Rounded National Status Rank</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/ranking.htm#natsub\">N5</a> - Secure</p>","agents":[{"full_name":"Cordeiro, J.","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"NatureServe","homepage":"http://www.natureserve.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"66e92803aa0267c3d202dcf2e737c94a","dataObjectVersionID":28859854,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#ConservationStatus","mimeType":"text/html","title":"NatureServe Conservation Status","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<p><strong>Rounded Global Status Rank</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/ranking.htm#globalstatus\">G5</a> - Secure</p><p><strong>Reasons</strong>: Native range extends from the Mississippi-Ohio confluence down the Mississippi River floodplain to Louisiana, and along the Gulf coastal Plain southwest to Alabama, to the Rio Grande basin in south New Mexico and north Mexico.

The video from a confocal stack (Figure 13Aii) was imaged from the ventral surface through to the mid-brain of a P. clarkii brain at hatching (approximately 26 \u03bcm into the brain tissue). There are three labels: (1) dextran dye (green) micro-injected into the cerebral artery via the dorsal sinus combined with (2) the S-phase marker BrdU (red) identifying the cap and the immunolocalization of (3) tyrosinated tubulin (white) delineating the protoniche and its pore. The video shows that the cerebral artery bifurcates and then pushes ventrally toward the two hemispheres, each branch dividing laterally and then many times over into the neuropile regions as continuous tubes. The protoniche has blood vessels confluent with its structure and connects to blood vessels slightly deeper into the tissue. The central pore, considered as an early stage of the cavity, is confluent with the blood vasculature.","mediaURL":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Neurogenesis-in-the-central-olfactory-pathway-of-adult-decapod-crustaceans-development-of-the-1749-8104-7-1-S1.ogv","eolMediaURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2013/12/08/06/37226.ogg","agents":[{"full_name":"Sintoni S, Benton J, Beltz B, Hansson B, Harzsch S","homepage":"","role":"creator"},{"full_name":"Wikimedia Commons","homepage":"http://commons.wikimedia.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"b06110491a48778b871b22e2e4ca9b0f","dataObjectVersionID":21403357,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage","dataSubtype":"Map","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","title":"Discover Life: Point Map of Procambarus clarkii","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Discover Life and original sources","source":"http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<br>Please see details, credits, terms of use and the latest version of the map at <a href='http://www.discoverlife.org/20/m?kind=Procambarus+clarkii&b=EOL/pages/344571'>Discover Life</a>.<br>Explore <a href='http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Procambarus+clarkii&b=EOL/pages/344571'><i>Procambarus clarkii</i></a> in Discover Life.","mediaURL":"http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20m?map=Procambarus+clarkii","eolMediaURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2012/01/18/23/95508_orig.jpg","eolThumbnailURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2012/01/18/23/95508_98_68.jpg","agents":[{"full_name":"John Pickering","homepage":"http://www.discoverlife.org/","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"Discover Life","homepage":"http://www.discoverlife.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"a2b0d0c90738c36393952b8cb784a154","dataObjectVersionID":28859860,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage","dataSubtype":"Map","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"mimeType":"image/gif","title":"U.S. States and Canadian Provinces","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"NatureServe","source":"http://explorer.natureserve.org/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=Procambarus+clarkii","description":"<img src=\"http://content60.eol.org/content/2011/12/06/23/17639.png\"/><p>NatureServe conservation status ranks for U.S. states and Canada provinces.
