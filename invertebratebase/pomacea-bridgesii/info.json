{"wiki":["Pomacea bridgesii, common names the spike-topped apple snail or mystery snail, is a South American species of freshwater snail with gills and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Ampullariidae.","Subspecies","Anatomy","Apple snails possess structurally complex eyes at the tip of a cephalic eyestalk. These snails possess the ability to regenerate the eye completely after amputation through the mid-eyestalk. They are born with both gills and lungs.[2]","Distribution","The native distribution of this snail is Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Peru.","This species is non-indigenous in Hawaii since 1960 (Pomacea bridgesii diffusa), southeast Asia since the 1980s, and Florida since the early 1980s (Pomacea bridgesii diffusa).[3]","Offspring","Most apple snails lay their eggs above the water line. The eggs take 2\u20134 weeks to hatch. The snails can have as many as two-hundred offspring from one egg-laying event. Sometimes not all of the eggs are fertilized so they don't all hatch. When they do hatch, the snail has a chance of getting eaten by fish. Especially if you have an aquarium and your snail has babies. Its babies will most likely get eaten if small enough. If they are at risk of getting eaten, simply put them in a tank that has no fish in it.","Human relevance","This species is often kept as an aquarium pet, because of its wide range of shell colors, lack of appetite for live plants, and ease of care.","External links"],"create_time":1427249044.69948}
