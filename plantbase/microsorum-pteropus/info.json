It is found attached to roots and rocks in nature.","In the aquarium","Several cultivars of Java fern exist. These include the \"narrow leaf\" Java fern, the \"needle leaf\" Java fern, the \"Windelov\" Java fern and the \"lance leaf\" Java fern. Cultivation in the aquarium is not problematic as long as the rhizome is tied to rock or driftwood and not planted directly into the substrate. It can be easily reproduced from small adventitious plants which are formed on the older leaves. These new plants should be attached to a rock or driftwood with a thin wire, rubber band or fishing line until new anchor roots have been formed. once new rhizomes have formed these can be taken off and planted onto more rocks or driftwood It can also be done with cotton thread, as this dissolves in water after about two months. This plant does particularly well with fish that are normally detrimental to plants, on account of its relatively bitter taste.","There are other types of Java fern including java fern on coconut, which is commonly used for tying to bogwood.","Height: 20\u201335\u00a0cm; width: 5\u201315\u00a0cm; light: low-high; temperature: 18\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C; pH tolerance: 6\u20138; kH: 2\u201315. Can also withstand slightly brackish conditions.","External links"],"create_time":1427237156.45181}
