It is an aquatic plant native to Madagascar and is popularly sold for use in aquariums. It is endangered in the wild.","Description","It is an aquatic monocotyledonous perennial plant with tuberous rhizomes 3 centimetres (1.2\u00a0in) in diameter. The leaves are oblong, the leaf blade 15\u201355 cm long and from 5\u201316 cm broad, with a total leaf length including the petiole of up to 65 centimetres (26\u00a0in). The leaves spread horizontally beneath the surface of the water, and are little more than a lattice-like skeletal network of veins with no tissue between. The flowers are produced on an erect spike up to 1 metre (39\u00a0in) long, sticking up to 20 centimetres (7.9\u00a0in) above the water surface. There seem to be several forms of this plant in cultivation, some large, some much smaller.[1][2]","Cultivation and uses","The tuberous roots are edible. It requires water temperatures of 15-26 \u00b0C and pH of 5-7.5, and grows best in medium - bright light with about 600 Lux.[3][4][5] The substrate should be rich in nutrients.","It is a speciality in botanical gardens all over the world. It used to be in such high demand that it almost became extinct in its natural habitat in Madagascar.[6]","It is often regarded as a difficult plant to cultivate. This is mainly due to several problems: 1) it likes bright light and this encourages algal growth which is difficult to clear from the leaves; 2) newly imported bulbs grow well in the first year but often fail in the second year, apparently due to a lack of food in the bulbs (cause still unknown); 3) seeds may be produced but often fail to germinate or thrive. Some enthusiasts recommend strong water movement and high filtration.","External links"],"create_time":1427236949.28549}
