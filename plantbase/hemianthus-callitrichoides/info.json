{"wiki":["Hemianthus callitrichoides (also known as dwarf baby tears, cuba or simply the initials HC) is an aquatic plant commonly used as a foreground or carpeting plant in planted aquariums. The plant is native to Cuba and has relatively high light and CO2 requirements to grow well in an aquarium.[1]","H.\u00a0callitrichoides was first collected by Holger Windel\u00f8v in 2003 in Las Pozas, Cuba, about 90 kilometres (56\u00a0mi) east of Havana. Unlike the related Hemianthus micranthemoides, H.\u00a0callitrichoides is thought to be native only to Cuba.[2]"],"create_time":1427237103.44581}
