Salviniaceae and Marsileaceae (Marsilea, Pilularia and Regnellidium) form a monophyletic group of water ferns, which are all heterosporous, ie. produce two kinds of spores, large female megaspores and small male microspores.Many fossil species of Azolla are known from the Upper Cretaceous. Today there are only 6 or 7 species in this genus.Azolla species are difficult to identify because high magnification is required to see the distinguishing characters clearly. In addition, the plants are often sterile and thus lack most of the features essential for identification. This has led to many misidentifications, confused taxonomy and thus uncertainty over species distributions.<br /><br /><b>Morphology</b><br />The small plants of Azolla filiculoides are prostrate, with branching thread-like horizontal stems generally up to 5cm long.Numerous unbranched roots up to 5cm long hang below the plant, arising from the underside of the stem at branching points.The tiny leaves (no more than 1.5 x 2.5mm in size) are alternately arranged in 2 rows on the upper side of the stem and overlap like roof tiles.Each leaf is divided into 2 lobes:<ul><li>the upper lobe is green, several cells thick and bears numerous single-celled papillate hairs</li><li>the upper lobe has a cavity in which the thread-like blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) Anabaena azollae lives in symbiosis</li><li>the lower lobe is more-or-less colourless and only one cell thick except at the base</li></ul>Spores are produced inside sporocarps. The sporocarps are borne in pairs (sexes the same or different) on the first leaf of each branch, the lower lobe forming the sporocarp and the upper lobe forming a false indusium over the sporocarp:\t\t\t <ul><li>megasporocarps (female; about 0.5mm diameter) contain just one megasporangium, inside which a single megaspore develops</li><li>as the megaspore matures, floats develop above it, topped with a colony of cyanobacteria and covered by a dark conical indusium; collectively this is known as the \u2018megaspore apparatus\u2019</li><li>microsporocarps (male; about 2mm diameter) contain numerous sporangia, each containing 64 microspores</li><li>the microspores are clumped together with other tissue in massulae that bear barbed hairs called glochidia</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Look-alikes</b><br />Azolla caroliniana and A. mexicana are very similar to A. filiculoides. Although A. filiculoides is the common species in western Europe, both the others have been recorded, though some of the identifications are questionable. All three species are native in the Americas.They differ principally in:<ul><li>the number of cells in the hairs on the upper leaf lobes - A. filiculoides has single-celled hairs whereas those of A. caroliniana and A. mexicana have at least 2 cells (light microscope required)</li><li>the nature of the surface of the megaspore (female spore) \u2013 A. filiculoides has megaspores with a warty surface, while those of A. caroliniana and A. mexicana are not warty (scanning electron microscope needed)</li></ul>","agents":[{"full_name":"Alison Paul","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Natural History Museum","homepage":"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/index.html","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"d17a21a7da4882b8c24dd6600303a491","dataObjectVersionID":12486844,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#TaxonBiology","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Introduction","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Natural History Museum, London","audience":["Expert users","General public"],"description":"Have you recently seen a pond, lake or ditch that looks pink or red?

The colouration is caused by the production of anthocyanins, a process that is controlled by environmental conditions and/or by stress.<br /><br /><b>Life cycle</b><br /><br /><br /><b>Sexual reproduction</b><br />In common with other ferns, Azolla has 2 alternating generations:<ul><li>the main sporophyte plant that produces spores</li><li>the insignificant gametophyte on which the sexual organs develop</li></ul>Azolla is one of the few ferns that are heterosporous - they produce 2 types of spores, large female spores and tiny male spores. These form inside sporangia contained in sporocarps. The sporocarps are able to withstand sub-zero temperatures as well as desiccation, so can help populations to overwinter and survive adverse conditions. However, Azolla does not regularly produce spores in the UK, a process probably influenced by environmental factors.Females:\t <ul><li>megasporocarps contain 1 megasporangium, inside which a single megaspore develops</li><li>as the megaspore matures, floats develop above it, topped with a colony of cyanobacteria and covered by a dark conical indusium; collectively this is known as the \u2018megaspore apparatus\u2019</li><li>at maturity the megasporangium wall disintegrates to reveal the warty spore wall with its tangled hairs</li><li>a female prothallus develops, initially within the megaspore, later protruding</li><li>1 or more archegonia (female sex organs) form on the prothallus</li></ul>Males:<ul><li>microsporocarps contain numerous microsporangia, each containing 64 microspores</li><li>on maturity the microsporocarp and microsporangia break open to release the microspores, which are clumped together with other tissue in massulae that bear barbed hairs called glochidia</li><li>within the massula prothalli develop in the microspores</li><li>1 antheridium (the male sex organ) is produced on the prothallus</li></ul>The massula glochidia get caught in the hairs of a floating megaspore and the combined structure sinks. Fertilisation occurs and the resulting zygote (fertilised egg) develops into a new sporophyte the following spring.Azolla species are unique in that the cyanobacterium symbiont is transferred from generation to generation via the megasporocarp, rather than the new sporophyte requiring reinfection by the cyanobacterium.The relationship is mutually beneficial as the cyanobacterium has a niche to live in and the Azolla receives the nitrogen it requires.<br /><br /><b>Vegetative reproduction</b><br />Vegetative propagation in Azolla is extremely efficient. Plants break up very readily at branching points to establish numerous new individuals. If conditions are favourable, Azolla filiculoides can double the area it covers in just 5 to 10 days.Plants usually die back or sink in winter, though they can overwinter in milder climates. In spring when temperatures rise the plants begin to grow and rise to the surface.","agents":[{"full_name":"Alison Paul","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Natural History Museum","homepage":"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/index.html","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"1edea37033b00196a2d43abba3c4646c","dataObjectVersionID":22627174,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","created":"2011-08-09T10:10:57Z","modified":"2012-10-04T09:09:00Z","title":"Global Distribution","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Bibliotheca Alexandrina","source":"http://lifedesk.bibalex.org/ba/pages/2081","description":"<p>North and south America.</p>","agents":[{"full_name":"Bibliotheca Alexandrina","homepage":"","role":"provider"},{"full_name":"BA Cultnat","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Bibliotheca Alexandrina - EOL Ar","homepage":"http://www.eol.org","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"91ef07aab43b318173ab3e74c75763fa","dataObjectVersionID":13096137,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","mimeType":"text/html","language":"es","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Universidad de Santiago de Chile","description":"I, II, III, IV, V, RM, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X","agents":[{"full_name":"Pablo Gutierrez","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"IABIN","homepage":"http://www.iabin.net/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"99dc183e33f934a532fe167e541927b4","dataObjectVersionID":4928278,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Morphology","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Description","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rights":"eFloras.org Copyright \u00a9 Missouri Botanical Garden","rightsHolder":"Missouri Botanical Garden, 4344 Shaw Boulevard, St. Louis, MO, 63110 USA","bibliographicCitation":"Flora of North America Vol. 2 in <a href=\"http://www.efloras.org\">eFloras.org</a>, Missouri Botanical Garden.

It thrives in eutrophic conditions and can out-compete other floating water plants such as species of Lemna.It can spread by water flow along dykes or streams but is also spread by birds, animals and man. Man is probably responsible for the major spread, either by discarding excess plants from aquaria or garden ponds, or in some countries through introduction of Azolla as a green manure.A. filiculoides grows and divides very rapidly in spring and summer, and can cover a pond in just a few weeks. It is extremely buoyant and often covers the surface of the water body to such an extent that the plants grow over one another to form a dense mat that appears solid - accidents have occurred when people have tried to walk on it, not realising there was water underneath.","agents":[{"full_name":"Alison Paul","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Natural History Museum","homepage":"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/index.html","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"9778d558de789975b4ef107d9a2beb71","dataObjectVersionID":12495879,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Conservation","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Conservation","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Natural History Museum, London","audience":["Expert users","General public"],"description":"This species is not threatened.

Azolla pinnata was used in China until 1977 when A. filiculoides was introduced. A. filiculoides proved resistant to insect attack and, as it tolerates colder conditions, it is suitable for use in northern areas and for late winter and early spring rice crops.The Azolla can be utilised as a fertiliser in a number of ways. It can be:<ul><li>grown as a monocrop and incorporated into the soil before planting the rice</li><li>grown as a companion crop among the rice</li><li>harvested from ponds or other fields and applied as a mulch to the soil</li></ul>Azolla biofertiliser has many advantages over chemical nitrogenous fertilisers.
