The soil is usually a sandy loam or mixed gravel. Some streams are shaded, however, in all their sites <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Crinum</span> receive sunlight at least temporarily (<a href=\"http://www.amaryllidaceae.org\">http://www.amaryllidaceae.org</a>).

The elongated (up to two metres long) float in the direction of the current, or in stiller water are piled in loops. Flowering occurs mainly during the monsoon season (August-October). The inflorescence comprises five to eight flowers. The plant also reproduces vegetatively through the production of bulblets. <p><br/></p><p>The data on the phenology of water onion and water depth in Nakha river,  maintained by Mrs. Oy Onkhow (co-leader of a local community based organization \u2013 \u2018Pleun Prai Sri Naka\u2019 -  involved in conservation work in Ranong Province, highlights the following:</p> <p>January (average water depth of 3-4 m): germination from seeds and leaf production from bulbs starts</p><p>February - July (average water depth starts at 1-2 m in March and increases to 5-6 m by July): leaf growth</p><p>August (average water depth 6-8 m): flowering is initiated</p><p>September (average water depth 8-9 m): peak flowering</p><p>October (average water depth 6-9 m): seed formation</p><p>November to December (average water depth drops from 6 m down to 4 m): seed is dispersed and laves die back<br/></p> <br/>Preliminary observations on the mid areas of the Nakha River, by a team of IUCN scientists on the 3rd of June 2008 revealed the following: The speed of water flow in mid areas of Nakha River ranged from 0.25-3 m/s. The main population is restricted to a 600 m stretch (width \u2013 30 m; depth 1-2.5 m), which has a muddy substrate. The growth was very dense towards the edge of the river. The water flow in this stretch was below 0.3 m/s. The area received ample sunlight. The length of the leaves ranged from 1-3 m, with each bulb having 20-40 leaves. Several fish were observed in this stretch, beneath the thick growth of this plant, which provided an ideal refuge to them. A thin layer of sediment was clearly visible on the leaf surface. Clumps of washed out Water Onion were observed on either side of the river bank, these had been removed by the fast flow of the water.      <br/><br/>The Water Onion is a very important aquatic plant that functions as a keystone species in its aquatic habitats. It provides important habitat for native freshwater fish species such as the Soro Brook Carp (Tor soro), which use it as a habitat to lay eggs.  Other aquatic species such as water snails and frogs also use it as breeding habitat. Other native fish eat the young leaves of Water Onion.</div> <br/><b>Systems</b><br/> <ul class=\"systems\"><li class=\"system\">Freshwater</li> </ul>","agents":[{"full_name":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P.","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P.","homepage":"","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"IUCN","homepage":"http://www.iucn.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"ce7e70dc286722e86badd10352c30386","dataObjectVersionID":31011241,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Conservation","mimeType":"text/html","title":"IUCN Red List Assessment","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rights":"\u00a9 International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources","rightsHolder":"International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources","bibliographicCitation":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P. 2011. <i>Crinum thaianum</i>.

The population is severely fragmented by habitat loss (only 3-5% of the original habitat remains) and there has been rapid population declines in some areas as a result (70% decline in the Nakha River during the period 2003-2008), and there has been local extinction in some streams within its range. The threats to the habitats and the species (exploitation) are all ongoing, hence there is continuing decline in a number of parameters. The species is therefore listed as Endangered and it could well become Critically Endangered in the near future if these trends continue.<br/><br/>IUCN staff in the region are trying to raise awareness about this species and have also been promoting habitat restoration and reintroduction projects in an effort to conserve this species.</div>","agents":[{"full_name":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P.","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P.","homepage":"","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"IUCN","homepage":"http://www.iucn.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"92a2c3c07a4395baeecdcb2ef903fb99","dataObjectVersionID":31011243,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Trends","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Population","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rights":"\u00a9 International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources","rightsHolder":"International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources","bibliographicCitation":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P. 2011. <i>Crinum thaianum</i>.
