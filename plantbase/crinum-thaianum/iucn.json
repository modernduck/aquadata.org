The population is severely fragmented by habitat loss (only 3-5% of the original habitat remains) and there has been rapid population declines in some areas as a result (70% decline in the Nakha River during the period 2003-2008), and there has been local extinction in some streams within its range. The threats to the habitats and the species (exploitation) are all ongoing, hence there is continuing decline in a number of parameters. The species is therefore listed as Endangered and it could well become Critically Endangered in the near future if these trends continue.<br/><br/>IUCN staff in the region are trying to raise awareness about this species and have also been promoting habitat restoration and reintroduction projects in an effort to conserve this species.","assessor":"Soonthornnawaphat, S., Bambaradeniya, C. & Sukpong, P.","evaluator":"Hilton-Taylor, C. & Lutz, M.L."}]
