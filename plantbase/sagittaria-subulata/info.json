It is also recorded as a non-native on the Azores, and on the Island of Java in Indonesia.[4]","Sagittaria subulata is a perennial herb up to 40\u00a0cm tall. Leaves are submersed or floating, narrowly linear to ovate, not lobed. Inflorescence floats on the surface of the water.[2][5][6]","External links"],"create_time":1427237202.89918}
