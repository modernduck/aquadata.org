The stems will grow up to 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) and thus they must be trimmed periodically in aquaria. They are easily propagated by planting cuttings from the present plants. Cabomba will survive in most aquarium environments, including hard water and minimal light.[2]","\u00a7References"],"create_time":1427237002.05989}
