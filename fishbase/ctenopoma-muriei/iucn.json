It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for eastern, north eastern and western Africa. The records of <em>Ctenopoma muriei</em> of the Congo River basin could be a different species. More information is needed on the species distribution before an assessment can be made, and so has regionally been categorised as Data Deficient for central Africa.","assessor":"Awa\u00efss, A., Getahun, A., Hanssens, M., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P. & Moelants, T.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
