to the island of Borneo where it\u2019s restricted to southern and western parts of the state of Sarawak, Malaysia with a handful of populations across the border in Kalimantan Barat (West Kalimantan) province, Indonesia.","Type locality is \u2018Small peat swamp forest, 2.55 kilometers south of Batang Rejang ferry on road from Sibu to Kuching, Sarawak, East Malaysia, 2\u00b008\u2019N, 112\u00b000\u201930\u2033E\u2019.","According to Tan and Ng (2005) its range in Sarawak extends from Sibu southwest to Kuching and onwards as far as Matang.","It\u2019s been collected at several different localities and these populations are often labelled by collectors and enthusiasts to maintain accuracy and preserve pure bloodlines, e.g., Sibu, Matang.","Apparently the greenish lateral blotch varies in size according to collection locality, with specimens from Matang exhibiting a much larger spot than those collected around Sibu.","Many habitats around the former have disappeared as much of the zone has been turned over to housing projects."],"habitat":["A stenotypic inhabitant of\u00a0peat\u00a0swamp forests and associated black water streams.","The dense canopy of branches above means very little light penetrates the surface of such environments, and riparian\u00a0vegetation also tends to grow thickly.","The water is typically stained darkly with humic acids and other chemicals released by decaying\u00a0organic\u00a0material.","The dissolved mineral content is generally negligible and\u00a0pH\u00a0can be as low as 3.0 or 4.0.","The\u00a0substrate\u00a0is usually covered by fallen leaves, branches and submerged tree roots and at certain times of year the fish may be forced to survive within the moist leaf litter for several weeks as permanent water is not always available.","At the type locality the forest floor was covered with approximately 10 cm of undecomposed leaf litter with a system of 5-10 cm deep puddles.","Aquatic vegetation included Cryptocoryne pallidinervia and Barcleya cf. motleyi\u00a0and during periods of rainfall the entire forest floor was flooded and remained that way for a period.","Other fishes present included \u2018Puntius\u2018 pentazona, Rasbora kalochroma, Clarias teijsmanni and\u00a0Monopterus albus plus the congener Betta climacura."],"maintenance":["Can be maintained in a fully-decorated aquarium although many breeders prefer not to use a substrate for ease of maintenance.","Driftwood roots and branches can be used and placed such a way that a few shady spots are formed while clay plant pots or lengths of piping can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of dried leaf litter further emphasises the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry and the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial for fishes from blackwater environments.","There is no need to use natural peat, however, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","Like others in the genus this species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting.","You could add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum or Cryptocoryne spp., and a few patches of floating vegetation would be useful as well.","This species requires acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","As it naturally inhabits sluggish waters filtration should not be too strong, with an air-powered sponge filter set to turn over gently adequate.","Keep the tank well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all Betta spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an excellent jumper."],"diet":["Preys on insects and other small invertebrates\u00a0in nature with the stomachs of four dissected wild specimens containing arthropods including terrestrial ants and aquatic mites (Witte and Schmidt, 1992).","Captive fish\u00a0will normally accept dried products once they\u2019re recognised as edible, but should be offered plenty of small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0regularly to ensure development of optimum colour and condition.","Take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. seem particularly prone to obesity."],"behaviour":["Not recommended for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon.","It\u2019s care requirements and disposition mean it is best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate and outcompete it.","Some small cyprinids and loaches that inhabit similar environments in nature are suitable, but proper research prior to purchase is essential.","Mixed reports exist as to whether it\u00a0can be maintained in multiple pairs or harem-type groups comprising a single male alongside several females.","Some observe that although some chasing and squabbling over\u00a0territory\u00a0occurs actual physical damage is\u00a0rare, while others recommend keeping it in single pairs having observed sustained aggression towards conspecifics from the dominant individuals in a group."],"reproduction":["Bubble-nester. It\u2019s particularly important to provide plenty of cover for the female, and \u00a0empty camera film canisters or lengths of plastic tubing are often used to offer potential nesting sites.","Floating plants may be incorporated into the nest if present.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead, to ensure no gaps) because the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","The\u00a0pair\u00a0need not be separated prior to\u00a0spawning.","The male may construct the nest in a tube or canister, under a broad plant leaf or among fine-leaved surface vegetation, and will not usually tolerate the female in the vicinity until it\u2019s complete.","Just prior to spawning the body colour of the female pales and dark bars appear on the flanks, with the act itself normally occurring\u00a0below the nest in an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids, with the male wrapping himself around the female.","At the point of climax milt and a few eggs are released which the female proceeds to catch between pelvic fins and body.","The male then transfers them to his nest while the female recovers any that fell.","This cycle is then repeated until the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0that can take some time.","This is not a particularly prolific\u00a0species\u00a0with less than 20 eggs being typical although bigger broods of up to 50 are not uncommon.","Post-spawning\u00a0the adults can normally be left\u00a0in situ\u00a0although the female is no longer actively involved with the male assuming sole responsibility for guarding and tending the nest.","The eggs hatch in 24-48 hours, remaining in the nest for a further 3-4 days until the yolk sac is fully-absorbed, while the male continues to collecting and return any that fall.","Once the fry begin to swim freely the male will lose interest, but the adults do not usually eat their offspring.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones."],"create_time":1426710577.28532}
