The water is usually relatively shallow, between 4-6 metres, although it has been recorded as deep as 16 metres.","maintenance":["Arrange some piles of rockwork around the tank?\u00a0but leave some open spaces between them and use fine sand as substrate so that it\u2019s able to feed naturally (see \u2018diet\u2019).?\u00a0Coarser options such as?\u00a0gravel?\u00a0or small pebbles can inhibit feeding, damage?\u00a0gill?\u00a0filaments and even be ingested with the potential of internal damage/blockages.?\u00a0It will not harm plants so?\u00a0hard water-tolerant species such as Vallisneria, Anubias or Sagittaria?\u00a0species can be added if you wish.","Water quality is of the utmost importance since these cichlids are extremely susceptible to deteriorating water quality/swings in chemical parameters and should never be introduced to a biologically immature?\u00a0aquarium. The best way to achieve the desired stability is to over-filter?\u00a0the?\u00a0tank?\u00a0using a combination of canister filters and/or a?\u00a0sump?\u00a0system, and perform minimum weekly water changes of?\u00a030-50%."],"diet":["Aulonocara spp.?\u00a0are?\u00a0benthophagous?\u00a0by nature employing a method of feeding whereby mouthfuls of?\u00a0substrate?\u00a0are taken and sifted for edible items with the remaining material expelled via the gills and mouth. They\u2019re equally-skilled at hunting as grazing, tending to hover above the?\u00a0substrate?\u00a0until tiny movements are detected, and possess enlarged sensory pores on the head which assist in this technique.","The captive diet should contain a variety of high quality, fine-grade prepared foods plus small live and/or frozen?\u00a0chironomid?\u00a0larvae,?\u00a0Tubifex,?\u00a0Artemia, mosquito?\u00a0larvae, etc.. At least some of the dried products should contain a high proportion of vegetable matter such as?\u00a0Spirulina?\u00a0or similar.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, can also work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife. Rather than a single large meal offer 3-4 smaller portions daily to allow natural browsing behaviour as this seems to result in the best growth rate and condition."],"behaviour":["A relatively peaceful species?\u00a0although males tend to act aggressively towards?\u00a0any fish with a similar colour pattern, so take care when selecting tankmates. Possibilities could include differently-patterened Copadichromis, Placidochromis, Otopharynx lithobates and peaceful Mbuna such as Labidochromis caeruleus. Other Aulonocara species are best avoided as most are able to hybridise, however, and the majority of Mbuna are excessively boisterous.","In all but the largest aquaria?\u00a0it\u2019s best to maintain just a single male alongside 4-6 females."],"reproduction":["Maternal mouthbrooder which will often spawn in a community set-up, but should be moved or maintained in a specific tank if the intention is to maximise yield. Males can be aggressive in pursuit of females so a ratio of a single male to 4 or more females is normally recommended in order to reduce the attention on any particular individual.?\u00a0Some flattish rocks and open areas of sand?\u00a0should be included to act as potential spawning sites.","The male will select one such?\u00a0site and begin his courtship display and?\u00a0when a female is willing she will approach?\u00a0and lay a batch of eggs, after which she immediately picks them up in her mouth. The male possesses a number of \u2018egg spots\u2019 on the?\u00a0anal fin and the female is also attracted to these, but when she tries to add them to?\u00a0her mouth she actually recieves milt from the male, thus fertilising the eggs.","The female will carry brood for up to 4 weeks before releasing fully free swimming fry. She will not normally eat during this period and can be easily spotted by her distended mouthparts combined with a distinctive \u2018chewing\u2019 motion. If overly stressed the eggs?\u00a0may be eaten or ejected prematurely meaning care must be taken if you decide to isolate a brooding female. It\u2019s also worth noting that if a female is away from the colony for too long she may lose her position in the pecking order of the group so try to wait as long as possible before moving a female unless she is being actively harassed. Some breeders artificially strip the fry from the mother\u2019s mouth at the 2 week stage and raise them separately from that point.","The fry may still have some yolk sac remaining when released and do not require additional food until this has disappeared. If released with?\u00a0yolk sacs fully-absorbed, Artemia?\u00a0nauplii?\u00a0or similar can be offered immediately. They usually start to become sexable?\u00a0at around the 4 month stage."],"create_time":1426710352.40183}
