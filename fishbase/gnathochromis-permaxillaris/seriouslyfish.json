Dim lighting is recommended."],"diet":["","Live and frozen foods should comprise a large proportion of the diet. Dried foods can be fed, but less often."],"behaviour":["","Not a particularly aggressive fish and should not be housed with rowdy species such as Mbuna. It will mix well with similarly-sized peaceful Tanganyikan species such as Cyprichromis, Paracyprichromis, Altolamprologus, Julidochromis and Tanganyikan Synodontis species. It can be maintained in a group in a suitably sized tank."],"reproduction":["","Not often bred in aquaria and details are scarce. It is a bi-parental cave-spawning mouthbrooder. Apparently, it will excavate the sand from underneath a rock or inside a cave and use this to barricade the entrance. Spawning occurs inside the cave and both parents share the mouthbrooding duties. The free swimming fry are released after around 2 weeks and grow very slowly. In fact, it can take 3 years for an individual to reach sexual maturity. If you want to breed this species, we suggest a tank arranged as suggested above, with lots of choice of caves and dim lighting. If possible, it would be better (and more cost effective (this is not usually a cheap fish) to start with a group of juveniles and allow them to pair off naturally."],"create_time":1426711850.60124}
