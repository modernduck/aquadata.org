Some floating vegetation will help to make this flighty species less skittish. It\u2019s also equally at home in a fully planted setup. In either case, the water should be very well-oxygenated and make sure the tank has a well-fitting cover as it can leap surprising distances. The species is sensitive to poor water conditions, so tank maintenance must be stringent."],"diet":["","Unfussy, and will accept most live, frozen and dried foods. Try to make sure it receives some greenstuffs in its diet, as it is reported to feed quite heavily on plant matter in nature."],"behaviour":["","Very peaceful but it can intimidate much smaller or more quiet species with its activity and size. It makes an ideal shoaling species for the larger Amazon biotope setup, where it can be combined with similarly-sized characins, cichlids such as Geophagus, Satanoperca and Heros, catfish and Loricariids. It is a shoaling species by nature and should always be kept in a group."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in the hobby. It\u2019s probably an egg-scatterer."],"create_time":1426712006.61864}
