General threats in the region include decline of its aquatic habitat due to pollution, but this is not thought to be affecting the entire range of the species. It has a wide range and is unlikely to be threatened at present. Therefore it is assessed as Least Concern.","assessor":"Allen, D.J.","evaluator":"Freyhof, J. & Darwall, W.R.T."}]
