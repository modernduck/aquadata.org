Arrange these to provide some hiding places for the fish, and try to provide a moderate current through the tank. It can also be kept in planted aquaria as it will not chew leaves."],"diet":["","Relishes all kinds of shellfish, as well as worms and other live and frozen foods. It should be fed snails and unshelled shellfish (such as crab legs, mussels etc.) regularly, in order to maintain it\u2019s sharp teeth. As with other puffers, these grow continuously and become a problem for the fish if they are not kept ground down."],"behaviour":["","A generally aggressive and intolerant species that really should be kept alone. Its beak-like mouth can easily bite chunks from other fish, or in extreme cases rip them to pieces. It\u2019s also very aggressive towards conspecifics and should never be kept in groups."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in aquaria, probably due to its temperament (and pricetag!) restricting the number of hobbyists prepared to make a serious attempt."],"create_time":1426714013.40308}
