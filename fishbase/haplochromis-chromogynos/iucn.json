The current population density not known, and the species has declined since the 1970s but has been confirmed to still occur in Lake Victoria in low numbers. The threat responsible for its dramatic decline in the early 1980s was the introduction of the Nile Perch (<em>Lates niloticus</em>) to Lake Victoria. It appears that the population trend is starting to increase, however the biggest threat to this species now is increased hybridisation as a result of decreased water transparency. It is not known to what extent this is affecting different areas of the lake, but its current distribution is likely restricted to only a few locations, and it is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.","assessor":"Witte, F., de Zeeuw, M.P. & Brooks, E.","evaluator":"Darwall, W. & Smith, K."}]
