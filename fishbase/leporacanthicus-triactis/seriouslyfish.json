Provide hiding places and shade with some big chunks of driftwood and smooth rocks. Dim lighting is also beneficial, and it\u2019s imperative that the water is highly oxygenated, preferably with a good amount of movement. Consider the use of powerheads or large airstones to produce the desired effect. An efficient filter is needed to deal with the large amounts of waste these produce."],"diet":["","These prefer a meatier diet, which can consist of live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, chopped mussel and prawn and sinking dried foods. Algae and other vegetable matter is also taken though, and regular feeds of greenstuffs like cucumber or courgette are recommended."],"behaviour":["","Ideal tankmates include characins, peaceful South American cichlids and catfish such as Corydoras and other Loricariids. In a biotope setup with a lot of water movement, your choices are more limited, but possibilities include characins such as Anostomus or Hemiodus and reophilic cichlids like Retroculus or African Steatocranus. It\u2019s territorial with conspecifics, with this behaviour being particularly pronounced among males, so make sure there is plenty of tank space and potential territories if you want to keep a group."],"reproduction":["","Not known to have been bred in the hobby. It spawns in deep holes in river banks during the wet season in nature."],"create_time":1426712477.23546}
