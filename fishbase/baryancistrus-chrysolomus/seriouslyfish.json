It\u2019s also been collected in the upper rio Curu\u00e1, a tributary of the rio Iriri which is itself an affluent of the Xingu.","habitat":"Often collected from whitewater rapids although appears to show a preference for stiller habitats with young specimens observed to shelter under rocks in marginal zones with slow to moderately-flowing water. Adults were found under larger, flat rocks on the bed of the river. Syntopic fishes included Peckoltia vittata and an unidentified Hypostomus sp.","maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions but largely unsuitable for the \u2018general\u2019\u00a0community aquarium. We recommend keeping it in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0gravel\u00a0and some large water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, roots and tough aquatic plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp., which can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor. Bright lighting will promote the growth of\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0upon which the fish will\u00a0graze.","Like many\u00a0species\u00a0that naturally inhabit running waters it\u2019s intolerant to the accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water at all times in order to thrive. It\u2019s also essential to provide sufficient levels of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and water movement using a combination of canister filters, powerheads, etc., particularly if the aim is for the fish to breed. Weekly water changes of 40-70% should also be considered mandatory."],"diet":["Gut analyses of wild specimens revealed the diet to be composed chiefly of algae, particularly diatoms and filamentous genera such as\u00a0Spirogyra\u00a0alongside smaller amounts of invertebrates such as chironomids and bryozoans.","In the aquarium aufwuchs should thus be allowed to colonise all surfaces except the viewing pane so that the fish can browse naturally although the diet should of course be supplemented with high-quality, sinking dried foods (preferably with added vegetable content), live or frozen bloodworm and similar, plus slices of fresh fruit and vegetables and the occasional defrosted prawn or shrimp.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of pur\u00e9ed fish food, shellfish, fruit and vegetables, are also proven to work well and in many ways represent the ideal staple diet since the ingredients can be altered at will, and when made well such foods contain a greater concentration and diversity of nutrients than any of the other options.","Baryancistrus\u00a0spp. are often under-nourished and/or suffering from health issues post-importation and may require an extended period of quarantine and acclimatisation.\u00a0They also have a relatively high metabolic rate and may initially require several meals per day."],"behaviour":["Juveniles are relatively peaceful but males in particular become highly intolerant of\u00a0conspecifics as they age and typically aggressive towards any other fish viewed as a territorial threat.","It\u2019s therefore best kept with\u00a0species\u00a0that inhabit other areas of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with medium-to-large sized characids particularly suitable. In very large aquaria you may be able to combine it with other catfishes or maintain a group provided care is taken to provide sufficient territorial space and visual barriers when laying out the d\u00e9cor."],"reproduction":"Unreported.","create_time":1426710516.77072}
