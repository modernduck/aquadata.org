When coarser gravel is used it may become stressed or damage itself, and feeding behaviour can be inhibited.","A few driftwood roots and branches, placed in such a way that plenty of shady spots are formed, can be used to add structure to the display and addition of dried leaf litter would provide additional cover and aid in simulating natural conditions.","Fairly dim lighting is also preferable and aquatic plants such as\u00a0Microsorum, Taxiphyllum,\u00a0and\u00a0Cryptocoryne spp. can be added.","Gentle filtration providing a little surface agitation is adequate and high flow rates best avoided. Ensure that small specimens are unable to enter filter intakes and cover the tank well as most loaches do jump at times, especially when introduced to a new environment."],"diet":["Chiefly a micropredator sifting mouthfuls of substrate through the mouth and gills from which insect larvae, small crustaceans and suchlike are extracted with a proportion of the natural diet also likely to comprise organic detritus and plant material from the gut contents of prey.","In the aquarium it will accept sinking dried foods but should also be offered regular meals of live and frozen Daphnia, Artemia, bloodworm, micro worm, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Pangio spp. are peaceful both with one another and other fishes and there exist no reports of them harming tankmates though they may prey on eggs or\u00a0fry.","In nature they\u2019re often found in large aggregations and in captivity will often pack themselves into a single nook, cranny or cave when at rest, so a group of at least 5-6 specimens should be the minimum purchased.","Diminutive, peaceful\u00a0species from similar environments including genera such as\u00a0Boraras,\u00a0Sundadanio, smaller\u00a0Rasbora,\u00a0Trichopsis,\u00a0Sphaerichthys,\u00a0Kottelatlimia, etc. constitute the best tankmates.","Some sand-dwelling loaches from the family Nemacheilidae are also suitable but proper research is essential as some can be excessively territorial, aggressive or otherwise competitive."],"reproduction":"Has not been bred in captivity as far as we know. According to Rainboth (1996) spawning occurs in shallow water with abundant vegetation.","create_time":1426713093.93092}
