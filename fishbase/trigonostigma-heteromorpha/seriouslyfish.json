In the latter it is more widely-distributed and has been collected from areas of peat swamp forest in the states of Selangor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor.","In Singapore it is found in Nee Soon Swamp, one of the last remaining pockets of pristine freshwater forest swamp found in the central catchment area of the island.","The extent of its distribution in the Greater Sunda Islands is less clear. While it certainly occurs on the island of Bintan in Riau Islands province, Sumatra, we\u2019ve been unable to find definitive information regarding the mainland other than a vague reference to the city of Medan in the north (the species is said to range throughout northern Sumatra). Similarly there appears not to exist a single confirmed occurence from Borneo.","The fish are known to vary somewhat depending on collection locality, with those collected from Johor and southern Thailand having an overall smaller, slimmer appearance than the Singapore and Sunda Island populations (see \u2018Notes\u2019).","Wild caught examples are\u00a0rare in the hobby as it\u2019s produced on a commercial basis in several countries."],"habitat":["Mostly inhabits gently flowing sections of forest streams and tributaries where submerged aquatic plants such as Cryptocoryne species grow thickly.","The water is sometimes stained faintly brown to yellowish due to the presence of tannins and other chemicals released by decomposing organic matter and the substrate scattered with fallen leaves, twigs and branches.","Such environments characteristically contain soft, weakly acidic to neutral water and are often dimly-lit due to dense marginal vegetation and the forest canopy above."],"maintenance":["Choice of decor is not especially critical although it tends to show better colouration when maintained in a well-furnished set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate, and it\u2019s a relatively popular choice for carefully-aquascaped arrangements.","A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves will aid in simulating a\u00a0blackwater\u00a0environment. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are recommended since they will grow under such conditions.","A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective."],"diet":["Stomach analyses of wild specimens have revealed it to be a micropredator feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans and other zooplankton.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia, alongside good quality dried flakes and granules."],"behaviour":["This species is very peaceful indeed making it an ideal resident of the well-maintained community tank and an unreserved recommendation for those new to fishkeeping.","As it places no special demands in terms of water chemistry it can be combined with many of the most popular fish in the hobby including other small cyprinids as well as tetras, livebearers, dwarf cichlids, catfishes, and loaches.","A well-chosen community based around fish native to Peninsular Malaysia would also make an attractive display with some of the more commonly exported examples include \u2018Puntius\u2018 lineatus, \u2018P.\u2018 pentazona, Trigonopoma pauciperforatum, T. gracile, Rasbora einthovenii, Brevibora dorsiocellata and Pangio spp.","As always thorough research is essential when choosing tankmates and its small adult size must be a consideration. It also makes an ideal companion for shy anabantoids such as Sphaerichthys\u00a0or the more diminutive Betta spp.","It\u2019s a schooling species by nature and really should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens.","Maintaining it in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but will result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Males will also display their best colours as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["This\u00a0species\u00a0exhibits no\u00a0parental care\u00a0although it does utilise a different\u00a0spawning\u00a0method to most small cyprinids as the eggs are attached to the underside of broad plant leaves or other objects rather than scattered randomly.","When the fish are in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a densely-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of young may start to appear without human intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of\u00a0fry\u00a0a slightly more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but a separate tank should also be set up.","This should be very dimly lit with the\u00a0base\u00a0either left bare or covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plant can pass through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works very well.","The water itself should ideally be of\u00a0pH\u00a05.0-6.0, 1-5\u00b0H with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above.","A decent-sized clump of\u00a0Microsorium,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, other broad-leaved plant or artificial alternative should also be included. Filtration is not really necessary but you can use a small, air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0if you prefer.","Some breeders of other\u00a0Trigonostigma\u00a0spp. report that older fish aged a year or more make the best subjects for\u00a0spawning\u00a0which may be the reason why this\u00a0species\u00a0is often said to be difficult to breed.","Apparently it\u2019s trickier to initiate\u00a0spawning\u00a0behaviour in younger individuals and they are also are less\u00a0fecund.","At any rate the best way to condition them is by feeding small amounts of live and frozen foods 2 or 3 times a day in the weeks leading up to a\u00a0spawning\u00a0attempt.","When the females appear full of eggs and the males are showing their best colours as they display to one another a large (40-50% of\u00a0tank\u00a0volume), cool water change should be performed and one or two pairs introduced to each\u00a0spawning\u00a0container a few hours later, preferably in the evening.","Spawning\u00a0usually occurs in the morning hours and is preceded by a flurry of\u00a0courtship\u00a0activity by the male(s). Often a\u00a0pair\u00a0will perform a number of \u2018dry runs\u2019 over a chosen\u00a0spawning\u00a0surface and it may be several hours before any eggs are produced.","Eventually the female will begin to lay small batches of eggs which are fertilised by the male before the next batch is laid.","The\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0is particularly interesting as often a female will choose the underside of a plant leaf and thus the\u00a0pair\u00a0will be observed in an inverted position as eggs and sperm are released.","If the\u00a0pair(s) fail to\u00a0spawn\u00a0immediately they can be left\u00a0in situ\u00a0but if no eggs have been observed after 3 or 4 days they should be returned to the main group and a different set of fish chosen. There is no need to feed the adults while they are in the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank.","Post-spawning\u00a0the adults will eat any eggs they find so either they or the eggs themselves should be removed as soon as possible.","Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but usually takes between 24 and 48 hours with the young free-swimming in around a week. Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or similar introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0and/or\u00a0microworm\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426714141.81614}
