The species is unfussy with regards to decor, but likes somewhere to hide. Some cover can be provided in the form of roots, branches or large, smooth rocks. Any artificial lighting should be very dim. A sandy or muddy substrate is beneficial but not essential. What is most important is that the cover of the tank cannot be moved by the fish and contains no gaps. It will escape given the slightest opportunity. A gap of around 6\u2033 should be also left between the water surface and the cover to allow it access to the atmospheric air it needs to survive. Obviously a massive and efficient filtration sustem is needed to cope with the amount of waste produced by a fish of this size."],"diet":["","Carnivorous and is easily weaned onto dead food in captivity. Large earthworms, whitebait, trout etc. can all be offered. Juveniles will take prawn, mussel etc. In nature they feed on anything from fish to invertebrates and even amphibians."],"behaviour":["","Best kept singly and alone. Don\u2019t even think about keeping any other species in the same tank as it\u2019s a voracious predator and is capable of killing fish that are larger than itself. It can be kept in groups of 3 or more individuals but obviously a suitably-sized tank would be required. It is unlikely that the hobbyist could adequately house such a group."],"reproduction":["","It\u2019s not been bred in captivity. Apparently the eggs are deposited in a nest built by the male, using his saliva!"],"create_time":1426711641.49609}
