These fish are famous for their ability to emit powerful electrical discharges, which are used both in predation and defense, of more than 500 volts (weaker electric fields are generated to gather information about the fish's surroundings). &nbsp;Depending on circumstances, the shock generated is potentially strong enough to pose a serious danger even to a large animal such as a human. Although musing about the electrical potential of this fish may simply alarm some people, others have been inspired to think about harnessing this power for fun, education, or more, as seen in this video about <a href=\"http://dvice.com/archives/2010/12/christmas-tree.php\">Electric Eel power in a Japanese Christmas display</a> (which has been extended to include <a href=\"http://ntdtv.org/en/news/life/2010-12-01/704144878673.html\">a human visitor-powered Santa Claus</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Electric Eels are mouth-breathers and will drown if denied access to air.

Juveniles feed on invertebrates, adults feed on fish and small mammals (Ref. 12225), first-born larvae prey on other eggs and embryos coming from late spawning batches (Ref. 40645).  The electric organ of this species consists of flattened electrocytes, numbering to about hundreds of thousands, connected in series (Ref. 10840; 10011).  Generates two type of electric organ discharges (EODs) from different electric organs which are of myogenic derivation:  1) low-voltage EODs (about 10 V) emitted by the Sach&#39;s organ at rates of up to 25 Hz, and 2) high-voltage EODs (about 50-fold) emitted by the main and Hunter&#39;s organs at peak rates of up to several hundred Hz.  Low-voltage EOD has been associated with electro location whereas high-voltage EOD has been noted during predatory attacks (Ref. 10011).  An EOD of 500 V was recorded from a 1 m specimen (Ref. 10530), making it a potentially dangerous species.  Incorporation of this species in fish-based house security systems has been suggested (see Ref. 9506).  Also possesses high-frequency sensitive tuberous receptors patchily distributed over the body that seems useful for hunting other gymnotiforms (Ref. 10583).  A nocturnal species; captive specimens showed higher low-voltage EOD activity during the night compared to daytime (Ref. 10011).  This cycle seems to be free-running (internally controlled) (Ref. 10829).  Probably a fractional spawner; fecundity count was17,000 eggs (Ref. 10630).  An obligatory air breather (Ref. 10011) and can withstand poorly oxygenated water (Ref. 26457).  Used in experimental studies.","agents":[{"full_name":"Crispina B.

Measuring up to 10 feet (3 m), it has three electric organs. Of these, two are used for navigation and prey detection. The third, and largest, is a formidable weapon. Split into two long, lateral halves, it discharges out of its tail, releasing up to 550 volts into its freshwater habitat. The shock stuns its prey, which consists of fishes and frogs, but it is also powerful enough to kill humans and even horses if they are present in the water when the eel discharges.\" (Shuker 2001: 53)<br/>&nbsp;              <a class=\"external_link\" href=\"http://www.asknature.org/strategy/cf1aee08559245ccc321c6cb77a2479a\">Learn more about this functional adaptation.</a>","agents":[{"full_name":"The Biomimicry Institute","homepage":"","role":"editor"},{"full_name":"AskNature","homepage":"http://www.AskNature.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":"Shuker, KPN.  2001.
