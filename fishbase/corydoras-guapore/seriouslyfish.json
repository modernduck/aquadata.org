The Madeira itself is a major affluent of the middle Amazon basin.","C. guapore has been recorded from the mainstream Guapor\u00e9/It\u00e9nez in both Bolivia and Brazil, which is unsurprising given that the river forms the border between the countries for a portion of its length. It\u00a0is likely to occur in various tributary drainages at least as far upstream as the R\u00edo Paucerna in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park.","Type locality is a \u2018Main stream of upper Rio Guapor\u00e9, Rond\u00f4nia, Brazil\u2019."],"habitat":"The Guapor\u00e9 is an acidic, tannin-stained river with warm, clear water.","maintenance":["Ideally use a substrate of fine sand, although rounded gravel is an acceptable alternative provided that it is kept scrupulously clean.","Other d\u00e9cor is largely down to personal choice, but some cover should be provided to give the fish security, ideally in the form of driftwood roots and branches, leaf litter and live vegetation at the water surface."],"diet":["Corydoras\u00a0spp. are foraging omnivores, and most will accept sinking dried foods as well as small live and frozen varieties such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex, etc.","C. guapore is slightly different in that it is partially adapted to forage on pelagic zooplankton (see \u2018Notes\u2019) meaning a diet containing plenty of live\u00a0Daphnia, Artemia, and suchlike is recommended.","Under no circumstances should they be expected to survive on \u2018left-overs\u2019 from other inhabitants of the aquarium or relied on to \u2018clean\u2019 the aquarium."],"behaviour":"Peaceful and gregarious. Should be maintained in a \u00a0group of at least 4-6 individuals.","reproduction":["This species is rarely bred in aquaria, although\u00a0when successful the method is typically similar\u00a0to that used for many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species.","Use a ratio of two or more males per female if possible, and when the females are visibly full of eggs perform a large (50-70%) water change with cooler water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare arrangement."],"create_time":1426711202.9571}
