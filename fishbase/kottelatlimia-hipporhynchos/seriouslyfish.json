The water generally has a negligible dissolved mineral content, is poorly buffered and tea-coloured due to the gradual release of tannins and organic acids from decaying plant material.","According to Kottelat and Tan (2008) it occurs sympatrically with K. pristes in some localities but whereas that species inhabits patches of leaf litter and other organic material K. hipporhynchos was observed \u2018resting on the sand substrate or diving into it\u2019.","In mixed lowland heath forest and peat swamps of the Kahayan river system near the town of Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan it\u2019s been collected alongside a number of other fish species including Osteochilus pentalineatus, O. spilurus, O. bleekeri, Rasbora cephalotaenia, R. patrickyapi, Sundadanio sp., \u2018Puntius\u2018 rhomboocellatus, \u2018P.\u2018 johorensis, \u2018P.\u2018 trifasciatus, Kottelatlimia pristes, Nemacheilus sp., Ompok supernus, Silurichthys phaiosoma, Hemirhamphodon chrysopunctatus, Nandus nebulosus, Betta anabatoides, B. foerschi, Luciocephalus pulcher, Sphaerichthys selatanensis, Channa bankanensis and Macrognathus circumcinctus."],"maintenance":["Must be provided with a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0since some of its time is spent completely buried, or with only eyes protruding. When coarser\u00a0gravel\u00a0is used it may become stressed or damage itself trying to dig, and feeding behaviour can be inhibited.","Other d\u00e9cor is not essential but could include water-worn rocks or driftwood branches and tree roots. These should be added prior to the\u00a0substrate\u00a0to prevent them being toppled by digging activity, and be sure leave open patches of\u00a0sand\u00a0between for the fish to move around in.","Lighting can be quite dim unless you intend to grow plants, which should ideally be of\u00a0species\u00a0able to grow attached to items of d\u00e9cor, while a few handfuls of dried leaf litter would complete the natural effect and provide additional cover.","Like many fishes that hail from pristine natural habitats it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water in order to thrive. For this reason it should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapts most easily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria.","Provided\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0is adequate water movement is unimportant although this\u00a0species\u00a0is also likely to do well in a\u00a0river\u00a0tank-style arrangement if the\u00a0substrate\u00a0is fine enough for it to dig."],"diet":["Chiefly a micropredator sifting mouthfuls of substrate through the gills from which insect larvae, small crustaceans and suchlike are extracted.","In captivity it\u2019s not difficult to feed but offer a varied diet comprising sinking dried foods plus live and frozen Artemia, Tubifex, Daphnia, bloodworm, etc."],"behaviour":["Not especially\u00a0robust\u00a0and shouldn\u2019t be kept with much larger or more competitive fishes. Diminutive\u00a0schooling\u00a0cyprinids\u00a0are ideal as are anabantoids such as\u00a0Sphaerichthys\u00a0or\u00a0Parosphromenus\u00a0spp.","If geography isn\u2019t an issue many smaller,\u00a0blackwater-dwelling characins should also work, while other\u00a0substrate-dwelling loaches could include\u00a0Pangio,\u00a0Acanthopsoides\u00a0or smaller\u00a0Lepidocephalichthys\u00a0spp.","Some nemacheilids are also suitable but proper research is essential as some can be excessively\u00a0territorial\u00a0or otherwise aggressive, require different water conditions or simply grow too large.","Kottelatlimia\u00a0spp. are peaceful both with one another and other fishes and there exist no reports of them harming tankmates though they may prey on eggs or\u00a0fry.","They seem to fare best in the presence of conspecifics and should ideally be kept in a group of 4 or more specimens."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded in aquaria.","create_time":1426712327.40916}
