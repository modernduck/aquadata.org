locality is given as \u2018Orinoco system, Venezuela\u2019, and this species is considered retricted to the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos of the R\u00edo Orinoco drainage.","One of the specimens in our images is said to have been collected in the rio Purus, Brazil, an Amazon tributary located some distance from the Orinoco."],"habitat":["The Llanos is a vast, highly biodiverse system of\u00a0tropical\u00a0savannah grasslands, seasonally-flooded plains and forests covering an area measuring almost 600,000 square kilometers in Venezuela and Colombia.","It\u2019s located to the north and west of the R\u00edo Orinoco and drained by many of that\u00a0river\u2018s tributaries.","There are well-defined annual weather patterns with distinct wet and dry seasons and year-round high temperatures.","Other fishes occurring in the region and available in the aquarium trade include\u00a0Corydoras delphax,\u00a0Platydoras costatus,\u00a0Baryancistrus beggini,\u00a0Hypancistrus inspector,\u00a0Panqolus maccus,\u00a0Panaque nigrolineatus,\u00a0Hemigrammus rhodostomus,\u00a0H. stictus,\u00a0Hyphessobrycon sweglesi,\u00a0Paracheirodon axelrodi,\u00a0Pristella maxillaris,\u00a0Copella nattereri,\u00a0Biotodoma wavrini, Geophagus abalios,\u00a0Heros severus,\u00a0Mesonauta insignis,\u00a0Satanoperca daemon\u00a0and\u00a0Uaru fernandezyepezi."],"maintenance":["Provided adequate cover and structure is available this species is unfussy with regards to d\u00e9cor with ceramic flowerpots, lengths of plastic piping and other artificial materials all useful additions.","A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy substrate with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed, plus one or two flat rocks or similar to provide potential spawning sites.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and with it bring the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry, while the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves aid in the simulation of natural conditions.","Aquatic plants can also be used with those from genera such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum, Cryptocoryne and Anubias\u00a0perhaps most useful since they can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Filtration, or at least water flow, should not be very strong and very large water changes are best avoided with regular changes of 10-15% recommended.","It goes without saying that this species should never be added to new or otherwise biologically immature aquaria.","When conditions deteriorate it becomes susceptible to a condition similar to that referred to as\u00a0\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or hole-in the-head in other species which initially manifests itself as small pits formed by eroding flesh around the head and lateral line pores."],"diet":["Mikrogeophagus\u00a0spp. are\u00a0benthophagous\u00a0by nature, normally taking mouthfuls of\u00a0substrate\u00a0which are sifted for edible items with the remaining material expelled via the gill openings and mouth, although they will also browse solid surfaces and snatch items directly from the water column.","In the aquarium they should be offered a variety of live and frozen fare such as bloodworm, Artemia, Daphnia, grindal worm, etc. supplemented by good quality, sinking dried foods of a suitably small size.","Wild fish may initially refuse the latter but normally learn to accept them over time.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife."],"behaviour":["Despite normally being sold as such M. ramirezi is not recommended for the general community aquarium since it requires pristine water quality and is a poor competitor, although that\u2019s not to say it must be maintained alone.","Groups of peaceful, open water-dwelling characids or similar are particularly recommended tankmates since\u00a0the presence of small schooling or shoaling fishes appears to be used as an indicator that there is no immediate threat in the vicinity and therefore can help reduce its natural shyness."],"reproduction":["This species is a biparental substrate spawner and is best bred in a dedicated set-up with no other fishes present.","There doesn\u2019t appear to be any particular trigger for the\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0with the main requirements being good diet and stringent maintenance regime.","The eggs themselves, however, can be tricky to raise and easily develop fungus or fail to develop unless the water is very clean and of low hardness.","Inexperienced pairs may eat their brood but often get things right after a few attempts whereas the commercially-produced fish (see \u2018Notes\u2019) tend to be of relatively poor quality and may fail to fertilise many of their eggs or simply consume them repeatedly.","Unless sexable adults are available it\u2019s best to begin with a group of young fish and allow pairs to form naturally, separating them as they do so, and we recommend purchasing these from a reputable private breeder if possible.","The eggs are normally laid on a solid surface such as a flat rock, piece of driftwood, broad plant leaf or directly on the aquarium glass, and spawning\u00a0occurs in typical style with the female laying one or more rows of eggs before the male moves in to fertilise them, this\u00a0process\u00a0being repeated numerous times."],"create_time":1426712716.428}
