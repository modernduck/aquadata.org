The species is therefore assessed as Least Concern. However, the population of this species in upper reaches of Krishna river has declined drastically and the species is possible threatened by urbanization, pollution and heavy harvesting. If such population trends are reported from other parts of its distribution, the species may qualify for a threatened category.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N.","evaluator":"Shrikant, J. & Cox, N.A."}]
