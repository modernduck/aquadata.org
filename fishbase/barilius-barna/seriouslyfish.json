Much smaller fishes should also be omitted as they may be predated upon.","The best tankmates are similarly-sized, robust, open-water dwelling cyprinids such as Dawkinsia, other Barilius or larger Devario and Rasbora spp. while bottom-dwellers could consist of Garra, Crossocheilus, Botia and Schistura spp., for example.","We suspect many characids and loricariid catfishes would also work well but be sure to perform thorough research before purchase.","Although\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature this is a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0which develops a distinct\u00a0pecking order\u00a0and therefore should always be maintained in a group of five or more.","If only two or three are purchased the subdominant fish may be bullied incessantly whereas solitary specimens can become aggressive towards similar-looking\u00a0species."],"reproduction":"Spawning can apparently be stimulated by performing large, cool water changes but as far as we know there exist no reports of fry being raised.","create_time":1426710508.48562}
