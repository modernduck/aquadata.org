Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting. You can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, especially\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also useful.","For breeding purposes acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness are required so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","There is no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","It goes without saying that this species is sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria."],"diet":["Probably a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will normally accept dried foods of a suitably small size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and somewhat specialised requirements","Ideally it should be maintained alone or at most with diminutive, non-aggressive\u00a0characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it is a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with rival males forming small territories and sparring on a regular basis.","8-10 specimens should be the minimum purchase since the fish will be less shy and display more interesting behaviour."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved and in a properly-structured,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","The main requirements are soft, slightly acidic water and provision of fine-leaved plants such as\u00a0Taxiphylum\u00a0or similar within which the fish will spawn.","Addition of leaf litter is also recommended due to the microorganisms which colonise it as decomposition occurs since these constitute a useful food source for fry.","Once in condition adults spawn on a daily basis so if attempting to breed this species in controlled conditions a pair or male and several females can be placed in a smaller aquarium and removed after a few days with the eggs and fry left to hatch and grow in the spawning tank."],"create_time":1426710383.1313}
