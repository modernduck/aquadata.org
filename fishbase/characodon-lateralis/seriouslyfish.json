{"images":[],"distribution":["","Endemic to the state of Durango, Mexico."],"habitat":["","It\u2019s mainly found in clear, stony-bottomed springs and streams. These are usually heavily vegetated."],"maintenance":["","A planted aquarium with a substrate composed of large gravel and/or small pebbles would resemble its natural habitat. A cover of floating plants is also recommended. The water must be kept scrupulously clean, so efficient filtration and frequent small water changes are essential. Any algal growth can be left alone, as the fish will graze on it."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and unfussy. The diet should contain live and frozen foods along with some vegetable matter such as blanched spinach or vegetable flake for the best conditioning."],"behaviour":["","Best kept in a species tank, not least as the species may be extinct in nature. Males can be somewhat aggressive between themselves, but develop a pecking order over time."],"reproduction":["","Not the easiest livebearer to breed, as initial broods may die for no apparent reason. Flock spawning (in which the fish are maintained and bred in groups) is the best method to establish a viable population. The breeding tank should contain lots of plants. Goodeids breed in a slightly different way to other livebearers. Females do not store sperm as in many other livebearing species and must mate separately for each brood of young. They also display no gravid spot.","Gestation takes between 55-60 days after which 5-20 very large fry are produced. Sometimes these may have what appears to be an umbilical cord attached. This is quite normal (see below) and will disappear in 2-3 days. The fry are large enough to accept the same foods as the adults from birth. The parents rarely predate on them. Breeding appears to be seasonal as after a couple of broods a female may not produce any more young for 6-8 months."],"create_time":1426710925.31235}
