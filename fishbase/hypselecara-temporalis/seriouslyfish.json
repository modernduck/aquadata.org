Plants can be used if you wish, as it doesn\u2019t usually dig. If you want to breed the fish place some pieces of slate vertically up the sides of the tank, to act as potential spawning sites."],"diet":["","It\u2019s omnivorous, feeding on a variety of invertebrates, algae and other plant matter in the wild. Happily it proves similarly unfussy in aquaria. Offer a varied diet including live, frozen and dried foods."],"behaviour":["","Despite its large size this is actually quite a placid species and can be kept in a community of large fish in a suitably-sized tank. Possible tankmates include large cyprinids, characins, catfish, Loricariids and in a very big tank, other South American cichlids."],"reproduction":["","Test"],"create_time":1426712240.81414}
