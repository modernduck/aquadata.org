It\u2019s been recorded from Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil in the Rio S\u00c3\u00a3o Francisco and Rio Essequibo basins, amongst others. A population is also thought to exist in the Rio Orinoco."],"habitat":["","Amazonian river biotope"],"maintenance":["","Will appreciate cover in the form of rockwork, roots and bogwood. Plants can also be used but ensure plenty swimming space is also provided. As with most large fish, decent filtration is required to ensure water quality is maintained at optimum levels. Dimmed lighting will encourage the fish to venture out into the open"],"diet":["","An omnivorous detrivore. Wild fish consume anything edible they find as they sift through the substrate, although a large proportion of the diet is composed of benthic crustaceans and the larval forms of various insects. Will accept most aquarium foods. Ensure vegetable matter and live or frozen foods form a regular part of the diet."],"behaviour":["","Gentle giant. Keep with other large peaceful species such as other large cats, arowana and large characins such as pacu and silver dollars.
