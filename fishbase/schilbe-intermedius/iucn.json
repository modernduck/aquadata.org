It is therefore listed as Least Concern. Although it faces some local threats, particularly in eastern Africa, it has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for central, eastern, north eastern, southern and western Africa.","assessor":"Bills, R., Cambray, J., Getahun, A.,  Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Marshall, B., Moelants, T., Ntakimazi, G., Olaosebikan, B.D. & Tweddle, D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
