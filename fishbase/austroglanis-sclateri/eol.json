Peter Saundry","source":"http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/51cbfa457896bb431f6bce7b/","description":"<p>The <strong>Orange River</strong> is the longest watercourse in Southern Africa. Lying south of the <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Zambezi_River\">Zambezi River</a>, The Orange River rises in the Drakensberg Mountains and flows westward to discharge into the Atlantic Ocean. The river has a length of 2208 kilometres and drains 48 percent of the land area of <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/South_Africa\">South Africa</a> and forms the national boundary between that country and <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Namibia\">Namibia</a>. The total drainage area amounts to 896,368 square kilometres, and the discharge at the mouth is about 11.5 cubic kilometres per annum.</p>\r\n<p>Excessive nutrient loading from overly intensive fertilizer usage in agricultural areas in the Vaal and middle reach Orange River is the major <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Water_pollution\">water quality</a> issue in the basin. Headwaters areas of the basin support high <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Endemism\">endemism</a> in <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Plant\">flora</a> and reptiles, while the middle reaches of the basin boast significant endemism in small mammals. Lower reaches of the basin support high endemism in both reptiles and small mammals.</p>\r\n<p>The chief <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Water_pollution\">water quality concerns</a> are within South Africa, and more specifically in the densely populated areas of Johannesburg, Pretoria and the Vaal Triangle. Exacerbating the issue are insufficiency and ageing of the <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sewage_treatment?topic=58075\">wastewater treatment</a> plants of that locale, and the fact that discharges from that high population density region is at a higher elevation than the principal dams along the Orange River; thus, inevitably polluted discharges from the densely populated area reaches these warm termperature reservoirs, which are then poised to generate elevated <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Bacteria\">bacterial</a> levels.</p>\r\n<p>Within the Orange River system 21 different fish taxa have been recorded, most of which are <span><span class=\"trunity_glossary\" data-type=\"glossary\" data-word=\"benthopelagic\"><a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/51cbfa457896bb431f6bce7b/#\">benthopelagic</a></span></span>. The three largest benthopelagic native species are: the 170 centimetre (cm) long North African Catfish (<em>Clarias gariepinus</em>), the 122 cm Flathead Grey Mullet (<i>Mugil cephalus</i>) and the endemic 92 cm Vaal-Orange Largemouth Yellowfish (<i>Labeobarbus kimberleyensis</i>). Other noteworthy native benthopelagics are the basin endemic 56 cm Orange River Mudfish (<i>Labeo capensis</i>), the 56 cm basin endemic Smallmouth Yellowfish (<i>Labeobarbus aeneus</i>), the 45 cm Redbreast Tilapia (<i>Tilapia rendalli</i>). <em>L aeneus</em> may be useful in <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Algae\">algae</a> control in the Orange basin, since this omnivorous bottom feeder consumes considerable algae in its diet. The 146 cm Wild Common Carp (<i>Cyprinus </i><i>carpio carpio</i>) is the largest introduced benthopelagic <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Alien_species\">alien species</a> in the Orange River.</p>\r\n<p>The largest fish species in the Orange River system is the 200 cm pelagic-neritic Leerfish (<i>Lichia amia</i>), which is a true aquatic apex predator, functioning at trophic level 4,5. Native demersal fish are the 40 cm South African Mullet (<i>Liza richardsonii</i>) and the near endemic 37 cm Rock Catfish (<i>Austroglanis sclateri</i>).</p>\r\n","agents":[{"full_name":"C.

Decline and possible extinction in the last 10 years probably occurred in Gauteng Province tributaries of the Vaal River, but over a relatively restricted area compared to its overall range. Therefore, criterion A is not applicable. The species is widespread, but may be restricted to suitable habitat within its overall range. There is little or no information available on small-scale distribution patterns, movement between possible suitable habitats or on population trends. However, its wide distribution suggests that criterion B is not applicable. The species seems to occur in low numbers, but due to its wide range, overall population size is expected to be larger than 10,000 individuals. Therefore, criteria C and D are not applicable. No quantitative analysis has been done for this species. Therefore, criterion E is not applicable. <br/><br/>There is concern that the species appears to be rare compared to other co-occurring species and pollution in tributaries of the Vaal River have caused local declines and possibly even local extinctions. However, the wide distribution and therefore relatively large overall population size of this species precludes it from any of the criteria, and is therefore assessed as Least Concern (LC).</div> <br/><b>History</b><br/> <ul id=\"assessment_years\"><li class=\"assessment_year\"> <div class=\"year\">1996</div> <div class=\"category\">Data Deficient</div> </li> <li class=\"assessment_year\"> <div class=\"year\">1994</div> <div class=\"category\">Indeterminate</div> <div class=\"source\">(Groombridge 1994)</div> </li> <li class=\"assessment_year\"> <div class=\"year\">1990</div> <div class=\"category\">Rare</div> <div class=\"source\">(IUCN 1990)</div> </li> <li class=\"assessment_year\"> <div class=\"year\">1988</div> <div class=\"category\">Rare</div> <div class=\"source\">(IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre 1988)</div> </li> </ul>","agents":[{"full_name":"Swartz, E., Bills, R. & Impson, D.","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Swartz, E., Bills, R. & Impson, D.","homepage":"","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"IUCN","homepage":"http://www.iucn.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"75f6a07f66c14fedaf80454f978a5b81","dataObjectVersionID":21121577,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage","dataSubtype":"Map","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","title":"Discover Life: Point Map of Austroglanis sclateri","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"Discover Life and original sources","source":"http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Austroglanis+sclateri","description":"<br>Please see details, credits, terms of use and the latest version of the map at <a href='http://www.discoverlife.org/20/m?kind=Austroglanis+sclateri&b=EOL/pages/204569'>Discover Life</a>.<br>Explore <a href='http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Austroglanis+sclateri&b=EOL/pages/204569'><i>Austroglanis sclateri</i></a> in Discover Life.","mediaURL":"http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20m?map=Austroglanis+sclateri","eolMediaURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2012/01/14/19/70644_orig.jpg","eolThumbnailURL":"http://media.eol.org/content/2012/01/14/19/70644_98_68.jpg","agents":[{"full_name":"John Pickering","homepage":"http://www.discoverlife.org/","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"Discover Life","homepage":"http://www.discoverlife.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]}]}
