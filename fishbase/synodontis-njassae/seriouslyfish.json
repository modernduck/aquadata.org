{"images":[],"distribution":["","This species is endemic to Lake Malawi."],"habitat":["","This species is endemic to Lake Malawi."],"maintenance":["","Should be housed in a Lake Malawi biotope setup, with piles of rocks arranged to form caves and areas of open water for swimming. Dim lighting will encourage the fish to be seen more often."],"diet":["","Synodontis are omnivorous and are most unfussy in terms of feeding. Frozen, live and dried foods are all accepted. It also relishes vegetable matter in the form of shelled peas, cucumber etc., which it will rasp at with the teeth in its lower jaw."],"behaviour":["","Should not be kept with any fish so small as to be considered food but makes a good addition to a community of robust hard water cichlids, ideally of Lake Malawi in origin. It is a fairly vigorous species and should not be combined with shy species. It will fight with other Syno species but is not aggressive towards conspecifics."],"reproduction":["","Not recorded in aquaria and little is known of its natural breeding habits. It is not thought to exhibit the brood parasitism method used by some Tanganyikan Syno species. It is found in large groups at night in certain areas of the lake, between the months of October-December, suggesting it breeds during the hours of darkness and is an egg scatterer."],"create_time":1426713962.45265}
