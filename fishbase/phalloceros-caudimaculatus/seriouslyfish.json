Consequently, water changes should be small but frequent.","diet":"Unfussy and omnivorous, it will accept most foods offered. In the wild it grazes algae and eats small insects, insect larvae and crustaceans. Frozen and dry foods are readily accepted in the aquarium.","behaviour":"Should ideally be maintained in a species tank.","reproduction":["Being a livebearer, it is quite easy to breed. If the parents are well fed and there are densely planted areas in the tank, the fry should be safe with the adult fish.","As the males can be rater persistent in their pursuit of females, having more females than males in the tank is advisable.","The gestation period is 4-6 weeks depending on temperature. The fry will eat microworms and freshly hatched Artemia as soon as they are born."],"create_time":1426713250.90766}
