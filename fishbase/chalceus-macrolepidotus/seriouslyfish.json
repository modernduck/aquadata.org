{"images":{"src":"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/chalceus_macrolepidotus_1-288x192.jpg"},"distribution":["","Found throughout northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Peru."],"habitat":["","Most often seen inhabiting the surface layers of highly oxygenated rivers."],"maintenance":["","It requires a lot of swimming space, so decor is not really critical, although a sandy substrate with some beech branches and floating plants looks very effective, and mimics many of its natural biotopes. The floating cover will also help to reduce bouts of skittishness, to which it is prone. Some water movement is also appreciated. Make sure the tank cover is very well-fitting, as it is a renowned jumper."],"diet":["","Feeds primarily on insects and aquatic crustaceans in nature. While dried foods are usually accepted, a good proportion of the diet should contain meaty foods such as prawns, mussel, bloodworm, chopped earthworms etc."],"behaviour":["","It does best when kept either as a single specimen, or in a group with more than 6 fish. In smaller groups, the fish tends to scrap with one another. Other than this, it is a good addition to many larger communities. Tankmates can include similarly-sized characins such as Leporinus, Metynnis, Mylossoma and Brycon sp., large Loricariids, Pimelodiids, and cichlids such as Geophagus or Satanoperca sp. Try to avoid other surface-dwelling species unless the tank is huge, as when mature it can be somewhat territorial. Much smaller fish will be eaten."],"reproduction":["","Has been achieved. Details are very scarce and all that is known is that a very large aquarium is required and up to 2000 eggs are scattered among vegetation. The young are apparently quite large and can be fed on brine shrimp nauplii as soon as the yolk sac has been absorbed."],"create_time":1426710872.73409}
