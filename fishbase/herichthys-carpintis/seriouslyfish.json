Plants rooted in the substrate will likely be uprooted as the Pearlscale Cichlid is a digger."],"diet":["","Omnivore. Should accept dry foods no problem. Feed a high quality cichlid pellet as staple and vary often with frozen and livefoods. Will especially appreciate brineshrimp. Also offer regular feedings of vegetable/spirulina flakes or similar."],"behaviour":["","Like a lot of the central/north American large cichlids, this fish can be very territorial \u2013 especially when breeding, and sometimes downright aggressive. Small fish will be seen as food."],"reproduction":["","Carpintis is a substrate spawner. A pair will bond, then start displaying to each other \u2013 circling around, flapping tails at the others\u2019 lateral line. If the partnership is agreed, both fish will change colour, to a startling black (rear part of the fish\u2019s body) and white (front part of the fish\u2019s body). ","A spawning site will be cleaned, usually a bit of smooth-surfaced rock. Slate is ideal for this purpose. The female Pearlscale Cichlid will lay the eggs, then the male will move in to fertilise them. Both parents will then fan the eggs with their pelvic fins to provide oxygenated water to the eggs. ","Eggs can take upto 2 days to hatch (at this point they may be moved into other designated spawning pits), and upto a week later the fry will be free swimming."],"create_time":1426712016.66347}
