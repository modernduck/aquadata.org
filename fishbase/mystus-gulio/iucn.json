Although it is often regarded as a species widely distributed throughout South and Southeast Asia, there is some evidence to indicate that the populations from Southeast Asia constitute one or more species that are distinct from populations in the Indian subcontinent (H.H. Ng <em>pers. comm.</em>). A taxonomic reappraisal of this species based on material from throughout its entire distribution is badly needed.","rationale":"Despite being targeted in artisanal fisheries, being sometimes harvested as an ornamental fish and demonstrated population declines in parts of its range, the level of exploitation is not deemed high enough to be a threat to long-term survival of this species, which is still considered relatively abundant. This species is therefore assessed as Least Concern here. However, it should be noted that there are taxonomic problems surrounding the identity of this species and it is likely that what is currently classified as <em>Mystus gulio</em> may consist of several species with more geographically circumscribed distributions. Should this be the case, it may be necessary to reassess this species in the near future.","assessor":"Ng, H.H.","evaluator":"Pal, M., Vishwanath, W. & Molur, S."}]
