locality is \u2018Goedverwagting, a plantation on the\u00a0Coast of Demerara, Guyana\u2019 but this species is widely-distributed throughout rivers of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana, plus the eastern Amazon drainage in Amap\u00e1 and Par\u00e1 states, Brazil.","It\u2019s also reported from the rio Madeira, lower and middle Amazon\u00a0as far upstream as the lower rio Negro, and R\u00edo Orinoco in Venezuela.","Though wild fish are still exported on a regular basis, many of those seen on sale in the aquarium trade are farmed commercially.","Wild populations vary in colour pattern depending on origin, and some populations have previously been described as distinct species (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"habitat":"Inhabits sluggish tributaries, small rivers and swampy areas, particularly in areas with dense growth of aquatic vegetation or submerged woody structures and leaf litter.","maintenance":["Should ideally be kept in a heavily-planted\u00a0set-up, preferably with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The broken lines of sight that exist in such a display allow it to display natural behaviour as well as helping to reduce skittishness.","Floating plants are a useful addition as are driftwood branches and dried leaf litter, the latter in particular driving\u00a0establishment of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","Such microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","Filtration need only be gentle with an air-powered sponge-style unit normally adequate, although a degree of water movement is acceptable."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful and will not \u00a0compete well with very boisterous or much larger tankmates.","In a community it\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes but sedate surface-dwellers such as hatchetfishes are best omitted, especially in smaller aquaria.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the tank, and does not often predate\u00a0fry.","In a more general community\u00a0set-up it can be combined with smaller rasboras, barbs, anabantoids, etc.","Buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above.","An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single\u00a0pair\u00a0or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container, though it\u2019s worth noting that the more individuals involved the greater the risk of\u00a0egg\u00a0predation, plus males may distract each other from females if there\u2019s more than one in the\u00a0tank.","The adults can be removed after 2-3 days and the first fry should be visible around 3 days later.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them.","In memory of late expert fish-breeder Alan P. Vaissiere who assisted extensively with this section."],"create_time":1426712824.76628}
