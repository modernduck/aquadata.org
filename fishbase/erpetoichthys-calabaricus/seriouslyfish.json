A tight-fitting cover is essential as this fish is an excellent escape artist."],"diet":["","E. calabaricus is carnivorous by nature and will not usually accept dried foods in aquaria, though some specimens have been known to take pelleted varieties. The most suitable options are meaty live or frozen foods such as prawns, earthworms, mussel, bloodworm etc."],"behaviour":["","Not to be trusted with tankmates it can fit in its mouth but is relatively peaceful otherwise. It can even be maintained in small groups as it is not particularly territorial. Good tankmates include Synodontis species, larger characins and cichlids such as Severum, Angelfish, some Tilapia species etc. It shouldn\u2019t be kept with very vigorous species, however, as it may be outcompeted at feednig time."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in aquaria."],"create_time":1426711675.671}
