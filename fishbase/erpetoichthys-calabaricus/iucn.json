The EOO is less than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The species is threatened by the oil palm plantations in the coastal region. There is ongoing habitat degradation and loss due to deforestation, agriculture and urban development. However it is thought that this species will be fairly resilient to habitat change. If the species was found to be impacted by these threats, it may meet the qualifications for Vulnerable B1abiii, but it is currently assessed as Near Threatened. It is assessed as Vulnerable in western Africa, and as Endangered in central Africa.","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Olaosebikan, B.D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
