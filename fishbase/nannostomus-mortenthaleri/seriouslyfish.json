an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases.","This species requires stable water conditions and should never be added to an immature aquarium."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","Ideally it should be maintained alone or at most with diminutive, non-aggressive\u00a0characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with territorial rival males sparring on a regular basis during daylight hours.","It\u2019s more aggressive than the majority of congeners, and in confined quarters serious injury or even death can occur.","For this reason a spacious aquarium should be used and d\u00e9cor arranged in such a way that plenty of broken lines-of-sight are provided.","Buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved in aquaria, albeit rarely,\u00a0and in a densely-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of\u00a0fry\u00a0a slightly more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more smaller containers should also be set up and filled with aged water.","Fill much\u00a0of the available space with fine wool mops,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or other fine-leaved aquatic plant.","Neither lighting nor filtration is necessary although you can install a small air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0if you prefer.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned one or more pairs can then be introduced to each container.","If using more than a single pair arrange the plants or mops in such a way that individual territories are created, e.g., with two pairs place spawning medium at either end of the tank with a space between.","The adults can be removed after 2-3 days and the first fry should be visible a day or two later.","If using mops, an alternative method is to check them on a daily basis, removing and replacing them as you find eggs and hatching the fry elsewhere.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them.","Adult patterning should develop after 8 weeks or so.","In memory of late expert fish-breeder Alan P.
