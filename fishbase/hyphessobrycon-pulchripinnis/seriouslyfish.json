The type locality is vague (see below), and the majority of subsequent reports pertain to\u00a0the rio Tapaj\u00f3s\u00a0basins\u00a0in central Brazil, one of the primary affluents of the lower Amazon River basin. The species is thus often assumed to be endemic to this watershed, but at least one\u00a0field observation suggests that it also occurs in\u00a0the rio Xingu system which borders the Tapaj\u00f3s to the east, and some have\u00a0suggested that it may not occur in the Tapaj\u00f3s at all (see \u2018Notes\u2019).","Nevertheless, most\u00a0records pertain to the middle and lower Tapaj\u00f3s in Par\u00e1 state, between the municipalities of Belterra and\u00a0Jacareacanga and downstream of the confluence between its two main tributaries,\u00a0the rios Teles Pires\u00a0(also known as rio S\u00e3o Manuel) and Juruena. There is also a report\u00a0from the rio\u00a0Kaiap\u00e1, a tributary of the Teles Pires\u00a0located several hundred kilometres upstream in Mato Grosso state. In the Xingu system it has been recorded from a single igarap\u00e9\u00a0in the lower basin, close to the municipality of\u00a0Senador Jos\u00e9 Porf\u00edrio (formerly known as Sousel/Souzel).","Type locality is unclear since the species was described from aquarium specimens, and was\u00a0given as \u2018locality reportedly Amazonas\u2019."],"habitat":"Likely to\u00a0favour minor tributaries, smaller rivers, oxbows, and flooded forests rather than main river channels.","maintenance":["Perhaps looks best\u00a0in an arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches, or heavily-planted planted set-up.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","The latter are useful since they provide an additional food source for both adults and fry while the humic substances released by decaying leaves are also considered beneficial."],"diet":["Probably\u00a0omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit, and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It is perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens\u00a0since this species forms temporary dominance hierarchies within which males compete for female attention, and therefore displays more interesting behaviour and better colouration when maintained in numbers."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention, but if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water. This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them. The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles. Alternatively, filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container and left in place until eggs are detected (typically the following morning).","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712204.70303}
