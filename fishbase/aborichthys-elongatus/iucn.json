At present the species is assessed as Least Concern, given the relatively wide distribution, and the assumption that it is probably present in watersheds between the two known localities. Further taxonomic work is required, and the assessment should be revised given further information.","assessor":"Vishwanath, W.","evaluator":"Britz, R. & Allen, D.J."}]
