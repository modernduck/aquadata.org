All hill streams in the region are threatened from decline in quality of habitat due to sedimentation from deforestation and agricultural practices. &#160;In addition, the species is overexploited for the aquarium fish trade and the impacts of proposed dams in the species' habitat is a potential threat, hence the species is assessed as Near Threatened with recommendation to monitor the situation for a future reassessment.","assessor":"Chaudhry, S.","evaluator":"Vishwanath, W., Britz, R., Dey, S.C., Jha, B.R. & Allen, D.J."}]
