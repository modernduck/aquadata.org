It is also found in the famous Pantanal wetlands of the Mato grosso, an area rich in aquatic plant life."],"maintenance":["","Quite shy and prefers a tank with plenty of cover. Areas of dense planting, with perhaps some roots and branches added for extra effect and a dark substrate would comprise a good setup. A layer of floating plants to provide dim conditions is also a good idea. Strong water flow is best avoided. It is found in many so-called \u201cblackwater\u201d habitats in nature, where the water is heavily stained with tannins released by decaying organic material. This can be simulated if you wish by adding a net bag containing aquarium-safe peat (such as moss peat) to one of the filter compartments."],"diet":["","It feeds largely on the scales of both conspecifics and other species in nature, and has specially adapted teeth in order to do so. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to feed live fish in the aquarium. The vast majority of specimens will accept chopped prawn, mussel, lancefish and other meaty foods."],"behaviour":["","Not a species for the community tank. Small tankmates will be eaten, while larger fish can be stripped of fins and scales quite quickly. Some hobbyists report success keeping it with Loricariids or Doradids, but this is an unstable situation and should not be considered long term.","Juveniles tend to form shoals, but an adult fish really should be housed alone, as a single specimen. Females in particular become particularly belligerent as they mature and will attack males constantly."],"reproduction":["","Unreported."],"create_time":1426710839.0219}
