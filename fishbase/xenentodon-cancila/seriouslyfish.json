locality is given as \u2018ponds and smaller rivers of the Gangetic provinces\u2019 but this species is currently considered to have a huge natural distribution extending eastwards from\u00a0Pakistan throughout much of India and into Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand.\u00a0It is a valued food fish across most of this range and is marketed both fresh or dried.","It\u00a0has been introduced in Hawaii where\u00a0at least one feral population has become established."],"habitat":["Tends to inhabit slow-moving to still sections of streams and rivers and marshy lowland habitats such as swamps and oxbows although at certain times of year it may also be found in fast-flowing waters and has also been collected from man-made canals and irrigation channels.","It is also a common inhabitant of temporarily-inundated flood plains during the annual monsoons which strongly affect the majority of its range.","At the type locality of Devario xyrops Fang & Kullander, 2009, X. cancila was collected alongside D. xyrops plus\u00a0Garra rakhinica, G. vittatula, Danio feegradei, Channa sp., Lepidocephalichthys sp.,\u00a0and Sicyopterus fasciatus."],"maintenance":["This\u00a0species\u00a0is a near-exclusive inhabitant of the upper\u00a0water column\u00a0and appreciates surface cover in the form of floating or overhanging vegetation.","Other d\u00e9cor is relatively unimportant but can consist of a sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with leaf litter plus some large driftwood branches and twisted roots.","Plants which can grow rooted in\u00a0sand\u00a0can also be added as can those which grow attached to solid surfaces such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp.","Lighting can simply be tailored to the plants being used.","If using a deeper\u00a0tank\u00a0you could fill it to 50-70% of capacity and add emergent branches and plants which can look very effective.","A tightly-fitting cover should be used as this species may jump when startled.","Efficient filtration is a must when keeping\u00a0predatory\u00a0species\u00a0due to the amount of waste produced so install one or more external canister filters and/or a\u00a0sump\u00a0system, organising the return in such a way that turbulent flow is avoided.","Weekly water changes of 30-50% should be considered mandatory as this\u00a0species\u00a0can be sensitive to\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and swings in water chemistry, and for this reason it must never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups.","Although sometimes referred to as such this species is not normally an inhabitant of brackish waters, though it may enter them from time-to-time at coastal localities, meaning the addition of marine salt is not necessary for its well-being."],"diet":["An\u00a0obligate\u00a0predator\u00a0feeding mostly on smaller fishes and insects in nature, and can be tricky to wean onto dead alternatives in captivity.","Smaller specimens can be offered\u00a0bloodworm, small earthworms, chopped prawn and suchlike while adults should accept strips of fish flesh, whole prawns/shrimp, mussels, live\u00a0river\u00a0shrimp, larger earthworms, etc.","Insects such as crickets or\u00a0are also ideal when fed live, although it is best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them flaked fish food or some kind of vegetable matter prior to use.","Take care not to overfeed as it will gorge itself given the opportunity.","Like the vast majority of\u00a0predatory\u00a0fishes this\u00a0species\u00a0should not be fed mammalian or avian meat such as beef heart or chicken.","Some of the lipids contained in these cannot be properly metabolised by the fish and can cause excess fat deposits and even organ degeneration.","Similarly there is little\u00a0benefit in the use of \u2018feeder\u2019 fish such as livebearers or small goldfish unless they are properly quarantined and conditioned beforehand, otherwise they bring with them the risk of\u00a0parasite\u00a0or disease introduction and tend not have a high nutritional value."],"behaviour":["Surprisingly peaceful with anything too large to swallow and can be maintained in a community provided tankmates are chosen with care since it is also a poor competitor.","This species is not aggressive towards conspecifics with juveniles in particular exhibiting a marked schooling instinct, and it is best maintained in numbers of four or more."],"reproduction":["Wild fish spawn between the months of May and September each year (Bano et al., 2012) and captive reproduction is also possible though rarely achieved.","Warmer temperatures of 28-29\u00b0C/82.4-84.2\u00b0F alongside a number of cool water changes may help to stimulate spawning behaviour.","It appears to be a continuous spawner with females depositing small numbers of eggs on a daily basis and apparently displaying a preference to do so where water flow is strongest.","Each egg is attached to submerged vegetation via an adhesive filament which can measure up to 100 mm in length, and these can be removed to a separate aquarium or container when observed.","Incubation period is variable to an extent but tends to be 7-10 days and the fry are able to accept Artemia nauplii within a few hours of hatching.","The young fish may need to be separated as they grow since larger individuals will eat their smaller siblings."],"create_time":1426714219.69361}
