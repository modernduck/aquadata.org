Around 45 kilometers north of Macap\u00e1, Amap\u00e1 state, Brazil\u2019."],"habitat":["Collected from small streams flowing through savanna grassland containing clear, light brown-coloured water with substrates of sand and gravel and little in the way of submerged or riparian vegetation.","At the type locality pH varied\u00a0between 5.8 \u2013 6.3, GH and KH were both <1\u00b0, conductivity was 9-13 \u03bcs\u00a0and temperature 24.7 \u2013 27.2\u00b0C/76.6 \u2013 80.1\u00b0F.","Other fish species included the congener\u00a0Hyphessobrycon takasei, plus a Nannostomus cf. beckfordi\u00a0and unidentified members of the genera\u00a0Aequidens, Acestrorhynchus, Leporinus and Rineloricaria."],"maintenance":["Perhaps looks best\u00a0in an arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches although it should also thrive in a planted set-up.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","The latter are useful since they provide an additional food source for both adults and fry while the humic substances released by decaying leaves are also considered beneficial."],"diet":["Likely to be omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It is best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention, but if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water. This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them. The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles. Alternatively, filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container and left in place until eggs are detected (typically the following morning).","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712134.5169}
