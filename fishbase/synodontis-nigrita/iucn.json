It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for western Africa. Due to a lack of information on this species- distribution and status, as well as taxonomic uncertainty, it is listed as Data Deficient for eastern, northern and north eastern Africa.  It is estimated that less than 5 % of the species is found in the central Africa region and it is therefore categorized as Not Applicable.","assessor":"Awa\u00efss, A., Azeroual, A., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Twongo, T.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
