Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it also does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and moderate water movement. Weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0aquarium\u00a0volume should be considered mandatory."],"diet":["Likely to be a generalised omnivore\u00a0in nature. Stomach contents analyses of the\u00a0congener M. obtusirostris\u00a0revealed it to feed on insects, crustaceans, worms, algae and aquatic plants, though it\u2019s unclear if the latter two were taken directly or via prey items.","In the aquarium it is easily-fed but for it to develop optimal\u00a0condition offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm), Daphnia and Artemia along with good quality dried flakes and granules; \u00a0at least some of the latter should contain added plant material such as Spirulina."],"behaviour":["Not aggressive but can upset slow-moving or timid tankmates with its vigorous behaviour, especially when feeding, so is best maintained alongside\u00a0robust, similarly-sized tankmates, especially cyprinids, loaches and other riverine fishes.","If you wish to maintain a Salween-themed community inhabitants could include Devario aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius,\u00a0Botia histrionica, B. rostrata, Syncrossus berdmorei, Puntius chola, Pethia stoliczkana, and various Schistura spp. As always when selecting a compatible community of fish proper research is essential, however.","This species exists in schools in the wild and a group of six or more should be the smallest considered."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded.","create_time":1426712770.37009}
