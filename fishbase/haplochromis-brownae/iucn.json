The main threat to this species which was responsible for its dramatic decline in the early 1980s was the introduction of the Nile Perch (<em>Lates niloticus</em>) to Lake Victoria. Whilst many <em>Haplochromis species suffered dramatic population crashes, many have shown signs of recovery in the last few years, however this species has not been seen since the 1980s. There are some unclear specimens that may represent possible hybrids of this species, however these are likely to be misidentifications. If it is still present it is likely to be extremely rare with very few individuals, and it is now Possibly Extinct. Should positive identifications be made this assessment should be revised.</em>","assessor":"Witte, F., de Zeeuw, M.P. & Brooks, E.","evaluator":"Darwall, W. & Smith, K."}]
