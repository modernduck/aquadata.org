It\u2019s found in numerous river systems, including the Rio Oyapock, Rio Essequibo, Rio Ucayali, Rio Solim\u00c3\u00b5es and the main Amazon drainage. It also occurs in various rivers in the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1. Wild fish are rare in the hobby these days though, with the vast majority of the ones on sale being mass-produced in the Far East and Eastern Europe.","habitat":"The natural range of this species covers parts of Colombia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Peru and Brazil.

Gentle water flow preferred. A tall tank of at least 50 cm is recommended for adult fish.","diet":"Omnivorous but wild fish feed predominantly on various items of zoobenthos such as small crustaceans and other aquatic invertebrates. today\u2019s tank-bred fish are far-removed from their ancestors Will accept pellet or flake food in the aquarium. Relishes live or frozen foods.","behaviour":"Generally a peaceful cichild but may squabble with it\u2019s own kind, so best kept in small groups. Good community fish but may eat small fish such as tetras.","reproduction":"Angels spawn on vertical surfaces such as slate, broad-leaved plants or even the aquarium glass. If you have a bonded pair, little needs to be done to ecourage them to breed. Ensure the fish are well conditioned with live food such as bloodworm and brineshrimp. Angels make good parents and will guard the eggs and then the fry, once hatched. Ensure the adults are kept well fed as it is not unkown for them to eat their fry. Fry can be fed with newly hatched brine shrimp after they have absorbed their yolk sacs (usually after two days) and then moved on to commercially available fry food.","create_time":1426713538.78239}
