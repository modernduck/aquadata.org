General appearance is shown in Figure 1; morphometric data are in Table 1. Body compressed. Ventral profile straight from lower jaw to caudal-fin base. Dorsal profile regularly arched to dorsal-fin origin, then slightly descending along dorsal-fin base, then horizontal to caudal-fin base. Suborbital spine bifid, outer prong straight, very short; inner prong slightly curved. Two pairs of rostral barbels, one pair of mandibular barbels(at posterior corner of mouth) and one pair of mental barbels. Lips finely pleated.</p> <p> Dorsal fin with 4 simple and 9 ( holotype ) or 10 (10 paratypes ) branched rays, last two rays sharing same pterygiophore (8-9&frac12;); distal margin straight to slightly concave. Caudal fin deeply forked, with 9+8 branched rays. Anal fin with 3 simple and 6 branched rays, last two sharing same pterygiophore (5&frac12;). Pelvic fin with 8 rays, reaching beyond anus but not to anal-fin origin. Pectoral fin with 13(8) or 14(3) rays, almost reaching pelvic-fin origin. </p> <p>Coloration. Based on examined material, live aquarium specimens, and photographs. Colour pattern of body and head complex, with conspicuous changes with growth, making it difficult to describe with accuracy. Pattern variable and therefore following description somewhat schematized. Smallest individuals with relatively paler appearance than larger ones, resulting mainly from dark markings being less contrasted and narrower. An ontogenic trend in decreasing pale areas and increasing dark ones, and evolving from a yellow body with a pattern of intersecting stripes and bars towards a black body with rows of yellow spots (through a widening of the bars and stripes and a reduction of blotches coupled with addition of median rows of spots in bars and stripes). Stripes and bars usually distinct entities in smallest individuals, fused and more or less merged in large ones.</p> <p>In smallest available specimens (less than about 40 mm SL; Fig. la), basic body pattern made of three stripes and five bars. A midlateral stripe running along lateral line, a ventral stripe from above pectoral base to lower contour of caudal peduncle, and a dorsal stripe from upper margin of eye to posterior extremity of dorsal base, parallel to but not touching dorsal mid-line. Anterior bar immediately behind gill opening, second bar midway between gill opening to dorsal-fin origin, third bar under dorsal-fin base, fourth bar at anal-fin origin, fifth bar on posterior third of caudal peduncle and base of caudal fin. Bars continuous across belly and back. Bars darker and more contrasted than stripes. Each bar with a median vertical row of one to five small, roundish yellow spots. Intersections of stripes and bars leaving four pairs of longitudinally elongated yellow blotches, and two narrow yellow saddles in predorsal area. Head with narrow bar through eye, a band from eye to posterior part of upper lip, and one from top of head to tip of snout.</p> <p>In specimens about 40-50 mm SL (Fig. 1b -c), colour pattern modified as follows: stripes become darker, as contrasted as and merged with bars. Bars and stripes widened relative to paired yellow blotches. An additional row of small roundish spots in midlateral stripe, and a few spots in dorsal and ventral stripes.</p> <p>In specimens about 55-70 mm SL (Fig. 1d): additional rows of spots in bars 2-4, in band from eye to upper lip, and in band on top of head, eye bar branched below eye. In specimens about 80-85 mm SL (Fig. 1e), additional row of spots in all bands, resulting in a general appearance of a black body with more or less regular horizontal rows of yellow spots. Large blotches much reduced, remaining as four pairs of horizontally elongated spots.</p> <p>Dorsal fin with a broad basal band (usually with a notch or a spot continuing row of yellow spots of third body bar) and a subdistal row of elongated blotches on rays. Caudal fin with three (small specimens) or four (specimens larger than 80 mm SL) vertical bands on each lobe, anterior one continuous across whole fin. Anal fin with two (small specimens) or three (specimens larger than 60 mm SL) bands. Pectoral fin with three and pelvic fin with two bands on dorsal surface, usually regular but occasionally branched or anastomosed.</p> <p>Etymology.

Similar discrepancies between Blyth's published data and those appearing on later ZSI labels are discussed by Ng &amp; Kottelat (2001) who concluded that there is no evidence to conclude that the label data are correct (they might be correct, but without supporting evidence it would be premature to accept them as correct). The &quot;Pegu&quot; localities possibly date back to Day (1870), but it seems clear from his various statements &quot;received from Berdmore at Pegu&quot;, &quot;received from Major Berdmore, Pegu&quot;, &quot;Pegu (Major Berdmore)&quot; that Pegu could have been the place of residence of Berdmore and not the place where he collected the fishes.
