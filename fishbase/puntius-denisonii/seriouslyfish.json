from \u2018Mundakayam, Travancore, India\u2019, which appears to correspond to the Manimala River near the town of Mundakayam in Kottayam District, Kerala state, southern India, and the species is endemic to Kerala plus the neighbouring state of Karnataka.","It\u2019s modern distribution is highly fragmented with small populations remaining in the\u00a0Valapatanam, Chaliyar, Kallar, Karyangod, Kuttiyadi, Chandragiri, Sullya, Kuppam, Iritti, Anjarakandipuzha, Bhavani,\u00a0and Bharatapuzha river systems.","Historical records from the Chalakudy, Periyar, Manimala, and Pamba river systems apparently represent\u00a0P. chalakkudiensis though the Manimala data may be questionable given it seems to be the type locality of P. denisonii.","In the\u00a0Achankovil River system it occurs sympatrically, and sometimes syntopically, with P. chalakkudiensis.","Wild stocks may have dwindled by as much as 50% in the last 15 years or so with collection for the aquarium trade largely held responsible although habitats are also being degraded by pollution from agricultural and domestic sources, plus destructive fishing methods involving explosives or organic toxins.","It\u2019s being produced on a commercial basis in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe though it\u2019s unclear if this has reduced the demand for wild fish."],"habitat":["A stream and river-dwelling species most often found in pristine, highly-oxygenated headwaters and upper parts of river basins where it typically congregates in rocky pools with dense riparian vegetation.","It\u2019s supposedly more active at dusk and dawn than during daylight hours."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep in a well-maintained set-up, though we recommend\u00a0aquascaping\u00a0the\u00a0tank\u00a0to resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized, water-worn rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0and perhaps some small boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood roots or branches, and while the majority of\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Since it naturally occurs in pristine habitats it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires more-or-less spotless water in order to thrive.","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it also does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and moderate water movement, and weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Benthic feeding, a foraging\u00a0omnivore\u00a0in nature feeding on a variety of worms, insects, crustaceans, plant material, and other\u00a0organic\u00a0debris.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but a balanced diet comprising regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia, and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0alongside good quality dried flakes and granules\u00a0will being about optimal condition and colours. \u00a0Sinking foods are best.","It\u2019s said that the\u00a0red pigmentation can be intensified by feeding a diet rich in carotenoids such as astaxanthin."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful but best kept with other riverine\u00a0species such as Danio, Devario, Barilius, Garra, plus robust balitorid and nemacheilid loaches.","That said provided its oxygen and temperature requirements can be met it can be mixed with most peaceful fish too large to be considered food.","Reports of\u00a0aggression may stem from the fact that often only one or two specimens are purchased due to its relatively high price.","It\u2019s a schooling species so 6-10 specimens should be the minimum considered under ideal circumstances.","Maintaining it in such numbers will not only make the fish less prone to bouts of skittishness but result in a more effective, natural looking display, and any aggressive behaviour will normally be contained as individuals concentrate on maintaining hierarchical position within the group.","The similar-looking P. chalakkudiensis is occasionally traded as P. denisonii (see \u2018Notes\u2019) and is known to be more belligerent\u00a0so it\u2019s also possible that misidentification may be partly responsible."],"reproduction":["Large numbers are produced for the aquarium hobby in commercial facilities, presumably via stimulation with hormones.","It\u2019s been reported that juveniles\u00a0are being over-collected from the wild and this appears to be exerting a detrimental impact on its\u2019 conservation status (see \u2018Notes\u2019).","In terms of private success at least one report of \u2018accidental\u2019 spawning exists, in which a couple of fry were discovered hiding among plants during aquarium\u00a0maintenance.","A more detailed report was published in the German magazine Aqualog in 2005. In this case a group of 15 adults spawned in soft, acidic water (gH 2-3/pH 5.7), depositing their eggs in a clump of Java moss (Taxiphylum barbieri).","Apparently several of the adults exhibited a colour change with the dorsal surface turning blue, and the event\u00a0appeared to be triggered by a gradual lowering of the pH\u00a0via addition of bogwood.","Chester Zoo Aquarium in England have also reported successful breeding, and their theory is that a large group of fish is needed as spawning is hypothesised to occur en masse.","This species has been hybridised with at least one other Puntius species which was presumed to be either \u2018P.\u2018 dunckeri or \u2018P.\u2018 everetti but is actually a member of the\u00a0genus Dawkinsia\u00a0(R. Collins, pers. comm.)\u00a0and such fish are now quite widely available."],"create_time":1426713571.63856}
