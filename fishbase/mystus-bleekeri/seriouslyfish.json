You will see it more often if the surface is covered in floating plants to cut down the light reaching the substrate.

Feed a varied diet to keep the fish in good health and displaying their best colours."],"behaviour":["","A peaceful and gregarious species but it will probably eat small fish when adult. It makes a good bottom dweller for communities of larger peaceful fish.
