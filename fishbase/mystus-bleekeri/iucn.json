Despite being targeted in fisheries in some regions of its distribution, the level of exploitation is not deemed high enough to be a threat to long-term survival of this species. <em>Mystus bleekeri</em> is therefore assessed as Least Concern.","assessor":"Ng, H.H.","evaluator":"Nguyen, T.H.T., Pal, M., Chaudhry, S., Vishwanath, W. & Molur, S."}]
