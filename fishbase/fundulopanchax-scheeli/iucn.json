Because it is easy to breed and maintain in the aquarium is not likely to suffer much wild collection by aquarists. However, it may be threatened by deforestation and habitat loss. The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy thresholds for Endangeres are met (with an EOO of less than 5000 km\u00b2 and an AOO 500 km\u00b2), and the species is only known from one  location (in lower Cross River in Nigeria). There is evidence of continuing decline in population and quality of habitat, so sub-critarion b is applicable.
