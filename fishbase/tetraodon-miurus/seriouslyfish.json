What is essential, is the provision of a deep (2-3\u2033) bed of sand as substrate. This will allow the fish to exhibit its natural behaviour (see below). Provide additional cover in the form of smooth rocks (interestingly the puffer will often attempt to mimic these), and driftwood pieces. Plants can also be used if you wish."],"diet":["","An ambush predator in nature, T. miurus requires a meaty diet. Offer prawns, earthworms, lancefish, mussel etc. Some specimens may initally only take live foods but most will take dead alternatives."],"behaviour":["","It is not really safe to house this species with anything else! It is a voracious predator that will eat any fish it can fit in its mouth, and will usually take chunks from larger tankmates. It is also completely intolerant of conspecifics. Some aquarists have had success keeping it with armoured Loricariids."],"reproduction":["","It has not been bred in captivity."],"create_time":1426714038.43387}
