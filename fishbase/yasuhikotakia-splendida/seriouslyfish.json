known only from a handful of localities in the Xe Pian river, a tributary system of the Xe Khong (which itself drains into the Mekong river main channel) in Champasak and Attapeu provinces, southern Laos.","If additional populations have been discovered by commercial collectors no details have been made available."],"habitat":["According to the description by Roberts (1995) all collection localities were similar and comprised small, swiftly-running, headwater streams draining foothills of the Bolaven Plateau and contained clear water with substrates of rocks and cobbles.","Other botiids present in these habitats were Yasuhikotakia modesta, Ambastaia\u00a0nigrolineata,\u00a0misidentified as A. sidthimunki, and an unidentified Syncrossus species.","The author also speculated that the species\u2018 upstream distribution may be limited by the Tad Saepha waterfall since no specimens were recorded above it."],"maintenance":["All botiids need a well-structured set-up although the actual choice of d\u00e9cor is more-or-less down to personal taste.","A natural-style arrangement could include a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of\u00a0sand\u00a0or\u00a0fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0with lots of smooth, water-worn rocks and pebbles plus driftwood roots and branches.","Lighting can be relatively subdued and plants able to grow in such conditions like Microsorum, Taxiphyllum or Anubias spp. can be added if you wish, these having an added benefit as they can be attached to pieces of d\u00e9cor in such a way as to provide useful shade.","Otherwise be sure to provide plenty of cover as\u00a0Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp. are inquisitive and seems to enjoy exploring their surroundings.","Rocks, wood, flower pots and\u00a0aquarium\u00a0ornaments can be used in whichever combination to achieve the desired effect.","Bear in mind that they like to squeeze themselves into small gaps and crevices so items with sharp edges should be omitted, and any gaps or holes small enough for a fish to become trapped should be filled in with\u00a0aquarium-grade silicone sealant.","A tightly-fitting cover is also essential as these loaches do jump at times.","Although botiids don\u2019t require turbulent conditions they do best when the water is well-oxygenated with a degree of flow, are intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water in order to thrive.","For these reasons they should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapt most readily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria.","In terms of maintenance weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["While\u00a0Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp. appear to be chiefly\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0by nature they will also eat\u00a0vegetative\u00a0matter if available, often including soft-leaved\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants.","They\u2019re largely unfussy feeders but must be offered a varied diet comprising quality dried products, live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, etc., plus fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach, or courgette.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients and bound with gelatin are also highly recommended.","Chopped earthworm can also provide a useful source of protein but should be used sparingly, and while most botiids also prey on\u00a0aquatic\u00a0snails though should never be considered the answer to an infestation since they\u2019re not\u00a0obligate\u00a0molluscivores.","Once settled into an\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they\u2019re bold feeders and often rise into midwater at meal times."],"behaviour":["Several SF members have experience with this species and all report it to be milder in temperament than some congeners.","That said slow-moving or long-finned fishes are best omitted with active,\u00a0pelagic\u00a0cyprinids such as many\u00a0Devario,\u00a0Rasbora, \u2018Puntius\u2018,\u00a0and some\u00a0Danio\u00a0spp. representing more suitable tankmates.","In terms of other bottom-dwellers it should coexist relatively peacefully with most Botia and Syncrossus spp. or in very large tanks, Chromobotia macracanthus. Some cobitid and nemacheilid loaches are also possibilities as are members of Epalzeorhynchos, Crossocheilus,\u00a0Garra, and many catfishes.","As always, thorough research prior to selecting a community of fishes is the best way to avoid potential problems.","Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp.\u00a0are\u00a0gregarious, form complex social hierarchies and should be maintained in groups of at least 5 or 6 specimens, preferably 10 or more.","When kept singly they can become withdrawn or even aggressive towards similarly-shaped fishes, and if only a\u00a0pair\u00a0or trio are purchased the dominant individual may stress the other(s) to the extent that they stop feeding.","That said they seemingly require regular contact with conspecifics, a fact exemplied by a number of behavioural rituals which have been recorded consistently in aquaria (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"reproduction":["No reports of breeding in private aquaria exist but some Yasuhikotakia species are farmed commercially for the hobby via the use of hormones (Y. splendida is not one of them).","A group of 15 adults maintained by UK aquarist Mark Duffill have produced eggs with free-swimming fry observed, and to date this remains the only account of spawning activity in aquaria."],"create_time":1426714284.59831}
