It is severly affected by the impact of dams, with the Thai population already almost extirpated due to the construction of the Pak Mun Dam. With the construction of the Sekong 4 and Sekong 5 dams due, a projected population decline over the next ten years is conservatively  given as 30-50% and the species is assessed as Vulnerable, however if the construction of Ban Koum goes ahead the  decline could be even greater.","assessor":"Baird, I.","evaluator":"Vidthayanon, C., Rainboth, W. & Brooks, E."}]
