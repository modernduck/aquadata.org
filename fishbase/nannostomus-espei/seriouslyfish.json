an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases.","This species requires stable water conditions and should never be added to an immature aquarium."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","Ideally it should be maintained alone or at most with diminutive, non-aggressive\u00a0characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with rival males sparring on a regular basis during daylight hours.","It\u2019s not uncommon to see nipped fins within a group though this behaviour does not normally extend to tankmates.","Buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved in aquaria, albeit rarely, and in a densely-planted, mature aquarium it\u2019s possible that small numbers of fry may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of fry a slightly more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more smaller containers should also be set up and filled with aged water.","Unlike the majority of congeners this species deposits its eggs in single batches on the underside of plant leaves, so a clump or two of broad-leaved aquatic plants such as\u00a0Anubias,\u00a0Microsorum, or\u00a0Echinodorus\u00a0should also be added.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container, though it\u2019s worth noting that the more individuals involved the greater the risk of egg predation, and this species will eat any eggs it finds.","This species is also highly selective in terms of choosing partners and you may need to try numerous combinations of adult fish before a viable pair forms, despite the bond being short-lived, i.e., the duration of a single reproductive event.","Once eggs are seen the adults or plant itself should be removed, with a separate hatching tank required using the latter approach.","The first fry should be visible after around 24-36 hours with the majority free-swimming by the 5th or 6th day.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, microworm, etc., once the fry are large enough to accept them.","In memory of late expert fish-breeder Alan P. Vaissiere who assisted extensively with this section."],"create_time":1426712838.20998}
