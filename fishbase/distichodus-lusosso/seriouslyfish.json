Furnish the tank with smooth rocks and driftwood branches instead. Sand or gravel can be used as substrate. If you want to try some plants, use species such as Anubias or Bolbitis, as most fish leave these alone. A little water flow is appreciated. It\u2019s an excellent jumper, so the tank must have a tightly-fitting, heavy cover."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and will accept most foods offered. It should be fed a decent proportion of vegetable matter to keep it in the best of health. A diet of live and frozen foods such as earthworms, prawn and mussel, along with frozen peas (remove the shells), Spirulina flake and blanched spinach would provide the desired balance."],"behaviour":["","Somewhat unpredictable. While some specimens remain peaceful with similarly-sized tankmates, others can become very spiteful as they mature. Certainly don\u2019t attempt to keep one of these with much smaller or shy species. Some of this potential aggression can be removed by keeping it in a group, provided enough space is available. Other tankmates in a big tank could include bichirs, large characins, cyprinids, catfish and Loricariids."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in the hobby."],"create_time":1426711613.01616}
