Daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, etc., will result in the best colouration and condition."],"behaviour":["Fishes which inhabit similar biotopes in nature constitute the best options, especially\u00a0\u00a0peaceful, open water-dwelling cyprinids since the presence of one or two schools can make a visible difference to the confidence of this naturally reclusive loach.","Other possibilities include rheophilic loaches from genera such as\u00a0Gastromyzon,\u00a0Pseudogastromyzon,\u00a0Beaufortia,\u00a0and\u00a0Sewellia,\u00a0plus benthic cyprinids like\u00a0Crossocheilus\u00a0and\u00a0Garra\u00a0species.","Some similarly-shaped relatives such as other\u00a0Nemacheilus,\u00a0Acanthocobitis,\u00a0and\u00a0Schistura\u00a0spp. are excessively territorial or otherwise aggressive, although a combination may work in larger aquaria.","This\u00a0species\u00a0is peaceful with conspecifics and seems to appreciate being maintained in a group so the purchase of four or more specimens is highly recommended."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded.","create_time":1426712882.97335}
