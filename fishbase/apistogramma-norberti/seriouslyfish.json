A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it bring the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, while the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves aid in simulation of naturalistic conditions. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks. A net bag filled with\u00a0aquarium-safe\u00a0peat\u00a0can also be added to the\u00a0filter\u00a0or suspended over the edge of thetank.","Fairly dim lighting is recommended and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are best since they will grow under such conditions. A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective. Filtration, or at least water flow, should not be very strong and very large water changes are best avoided with 10-15% weekly adequate provided the\u00a0tank\u00a0is lightly-stocked."],"diet":"Primarily\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0and feeds mostly on\u00a0benthic\u00a0invertebrates in nature. In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0live and frozen foods such asArtemia,\u00a0Daphnia\u00a0and\u00a0chironomid\u00a0larvae\u00a0(bloodworm) should be offered regularly although most specimens will also learn to accept dried alternatives with pelleted products generally preferred to flake.","behaviour":"Captive-raised fish are the recommended choice for the\u00a0community aquarium. Wild examples are best maintained alone or with small \u2018dither\u2019 fishes such as\u00a0Nannostomus\u00a0or\u00a0Micropoecilia\u00a0spp., and ideally should not be mixed with other\u00a0Apistogramma.","reproduction":"Substrate\u00a0spawner which normally lays its eggs in crevices or cavities among the d\u00e9cor. The female is responsible for post-spawning\u00a0care of eggs and\u00a0fry\u00a0and in smaller aquaria the male may need to be removed as she may become hyper-aggressive.","create_time":1426710233.73927}
