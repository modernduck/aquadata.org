The latter are particularly useful as their leaves tend to attract algal growth and provide additional cover.","Since it needs stable water conditions and feeds on\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass.","While regular partial water changes are essential\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0can be allowed to grow on all surfaces except perhaps the viewing pane."],"diet":["Much of the natural diet is likely to be composed of\u00a0benthic\u00a0algae\u00a0plus associated micro-organisms which are rasped from solid surfaces.","In captivity it will accept good-quality dried foods and meatier items like live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0but may suffer internal problems if the diet contains excessive protein.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients bound with gelatin are very useful since they can be tailored to contain a high proportion of fresh vegetables,\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0and similar ingredients.","For long-term success it\u2019s best to provide a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0with a plentiful supply of\u00a0algae-covered rocks and other surfaces.","If unable to grow sufficient algae in the main tank or you have a community containing numerous herbivorous fishes which consume what\u2019s available quickly it may be necessary to maintain a separate tank in which to grow algae on rocks and switch them with those in the main tank on a cyclical basis.","Such a \u2018nursery\u2018 doesn\u2019t have to be very large, requires only strong lighting and in sunny climates can be kept outdoors. Algal\u00a0type\u00a0is also important with\u00a0diatoms\u00a0and softer, green varieties preferred to tougher types such as rhodophytic \u2018black brush\u2019\u00a0algae.","Gastromyzontids are often seen on sale in an emaciated state which can be difficult to correct.","A good dealer will have done something about this prior to sale but if you decide to take a chance with severely weakened specimens they\u2019ll initially require a constant source of suitable foods in the absence of competitors if they\u2019re to recover."],"behaviour":["Largely peaceful although its environmental requirements limit the choice of suitable tankmates somewhat.","Species inhabiting similar natural waters include Barilius, Garra, Devario, some Rasbora, Rhinogobius, Sicyopterus and Stiphodon gobies plus catfishes like Glyptothorax, Akysis and Oreoglanis.","Many loaches from the\u00a0family\u00a0Nemacheilidae, Balitoridae and Gastromyzontidae are also suitable although harmless squabbles may occur with the latter group in particular.","Research your choices before purchase in order to be sure and please note that although usually sold as such members of this\u00a0genus\u00a0make poor companions for goldfish.","It exists in loose aggregations in nature so buy a group of six or more to see its most interesting behaviour.","While often said to be timid this isn\u2019t strictly the case; males are far bolder than females and if a group containing both sexes is present will form small territories in all parts of the tank, with the alpha individual(s) occupying the most favourable feeding spots.","These are defended against all conspecific males and the majority similar-looking species.","Females tend to congregate together in quieter parts of the tank with high water flow\u00a0and their presence in male territories is normally tolerated, with exceptions usually down to hunger rather than ownership of space.","If only two or three specimens are purchased this species can indeed become withdrawn, though, especially if all are female."],"reproduction":"Presumably a seasonal spawner in nature but nothing has been recorded in aquaria as far as we know.","create_time":1426710535.54174}
