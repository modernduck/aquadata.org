It&#160; was extirpated from Thailand in the 1990s and is now very rare in Cambodia, Vietnam and Lao PDR. The global population of this fish is suspected to have declined by more than 90% over the past 20 years after high levels of exploitation for the international aquarium trade. Habitat destruction and degradation from dams and infrastructure in tributaries are also significant threats. This species is assessed as Critically Endangered because of an inferred population decline of&#160; &gt;90% within three generations based on continuing declines in area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO), and habitat quality, and levels of exploitation.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Juffe Bignoli, D., Kottelat, M., Parenti, L. & Gibson, C."}]
