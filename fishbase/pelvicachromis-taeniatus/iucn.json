Regionally, it has been categorised as Vulnerable for both central and western Africa. In central Africa, Barrage fishing in the Fifinda region leads to sedimentation and habitat loss (threat not overfishing), the upper Mungo River basin is threatened by sedimentation and pollution from banana plantations (pers. comm. Victor Mamonekene, Cyrille Dening), whilst the central localities are threatened by oil palm plantations in that region. Both the EOO and AOO qualify for the Vulnerable status. In western Africa, this species is only known from three locations where the habitat is undergoing continued decline due to oil pollution, agriculture, deforestation and urban developments. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable B1ab(ii,iii).","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Olaosebikan, B.D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
