It tends to swim in groups around areas of dense vegetation and submerged branches. Many of these habitats are subject to seasonal changes in terms of water temperature and chemistry, making this an adaptable species."],"maintenance":["","This species, like most rainbows, looks most at home in a planted aquarium. Provide areas of dense vegetation, along with some open areas for swimming. Water movement should be quite gentle."],"diet":["","Unfussy and will accept most dried, frozen and live foods. Regular feedings of the latter will ensure the best colouration."],"behaviour":["","Very peaceful but can disturb smaller or slow-moving fish with its rapid movements and relatively large size. Good tankmates include other similarly-sized rainbowfish, characins, danios, barbs, and catfish such as Corydoras.\nThe New Guinea rainbowfish is quite skittish and does far better when kept in a shoal of at least 6-8 fish, preferably more. The males will also be encouraged to display their best colours in the company of conspecifics. Obviously a suitably-sized aquarium would be required for a very large group."],"reproduction":["","Breeds in a similar fashion to other Glossolepis species. Egg scatterer. The breeding aquarium should be at least 30\u2033 long. A pH of around neutral should be fine, with a temperature of 75-80\u00b0F. A small air-powered filter will provide sufficient oxygenation and flow. The tank should be filled with fine-leaved plants such as java moss, or nylon spawning mops. No substrate is necessary.","The adult fish are best conditioned as a group in a separate aquarium with plenty of live and frozen foods. Select the fattest pair for spawning and introduce them to the spawning tank. A small raise in temperature can induce spawning. The pair will spawn for a period of several weeks, laying a few eggs each day. These are attached to surfaces by a small thread. Although the adults tend not to eat the spawn, it\u2019s easier to raise the fry in a separate aquarium. We recommend checking the plants or mops daily and removing any eggs you find to a raising tank, containing water from the spawning tank.","The eggs hatch in 7-12 days, depending on temperature, and the tiny fry initially require infusoria-type food, before graduating onto microworm or brine shrimp nauplii after a week or so."],"create_time":1426712616.85184}
