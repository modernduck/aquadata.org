Ensure that any decor is either secured or is too heavy to be moved around by the fish. A large and efficient filter is needed to cope with the amounts of biological waste produced by a fish of this size. Given the fact it originates from hill streams, a good water flow with a high oxygen content would seem appropriate."],"diet":["","Most specimens are easy to feed, accepting a wide range of dried and meaty frozen foods. Feed a mixture of dried pellets as well as frozen prawns, mussels, earthworms etc. You may need to add food at lights out to ensure it gets its share, as it can be very secretive."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful for its size and does well in a community of other placid, similarly-sized fish. It will eat any tankmate it can fit in its mouth, so be warned. Decent choices include larger cyprininds and characins, other catfish, cichlids and the smaller species of Polypterus. It will not squabble with conspecifics and can be kept singly or as a small group."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in aquaria."],"create_time":1426712074.77789}
