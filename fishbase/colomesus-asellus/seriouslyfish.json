It\u2019s occasionally found in mildly brackish conditions."],"maintenance":["","Best kept in a well-planted setup with twisted roots and branches to provide additional cover. Add some floating plants to provide the dim conditions favoured by this species. Like most puffers, it is very sensitive to deteriorating water conditions, so regular partial water changes are a must."],"diet":["","Relishes all kinds of shelled invertebrates, as well as worms and other live and frozen foods. It should be fed snails and unshelled shellfish (such as crab legs, mussels etc.) regularly, in order to maintain it\u2019s sharp teeth. As with other puffers, these grow continuously and become a problem for the fish if they\u2019re not kept ground down."],"behaviour":["","Very active but quite placid for a puffer, C. asellus can be kept in a community tank with robust species. It will sometimes nip the fins of long-finned or slow-moving tankmates, though, so these are best avoided. Keep it with medium-sized characins, barbs, larger rasboras and robust, peaceful cichlids.","While it can\u2019t really be termed a shoaling species, it\u2019s sometimes found in loose aggregations in nature. It can also be kept like this without too much squabbling in captivity, provided the tank is large enough."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in the hobby."],"create_time":1426711047.78277}
