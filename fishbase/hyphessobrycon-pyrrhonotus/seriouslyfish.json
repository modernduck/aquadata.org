Formicidae).","Fruit and ants constituted 25 % and 20 %, respectively, of all items consumed.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0alongside good quality dried flakes and granules, at least some of which should include additional plant or algal content.","Submerged pieces of fresh fruit will also be grazed but should only be left in the aquarium for a few hours."],"behaviour":["Generally peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium, although adult males are territorial to an extent, and this behaviour may sometimes extend to similarly-shaped species.","It is perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle.","The interaction between rival males is fascinating to watch and they will display their best colours when competing for female attention or hierarchical position."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded but certain to be an egg-scatterer exhibiting no parental care.","create_time":1426712209.15025}
