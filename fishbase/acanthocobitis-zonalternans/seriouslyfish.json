There was no marginal or submerged vegetation and the substrate was composed of mud and sand.","A. zonalternans was collected in a depth of 0.3-0.5 metres alongside Pethia stoliczkana, Rasbora daniconius plus unidentified species of Lepidocephalichthys, Glossogobius and Channa."],"maintenance":["Will do well in most well-maintained aquaria provided sufficient cover is available, and should not harm softer-leaved plants. However we recommend keeping it in a set-up designed to resemble a slow-moving or\u00a0marginal\u00a0section of stream or\u00a0river\u00a0with a sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0and perhaps a few water-worn boulders.","This can be further decorated with driftwood roots and branches arranged to form some shaded spots, plus a few handfuls of dried beech, oak or\u00a0Terminalia\u00a0(Indian Almond) leaves.","Adaptable plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor and bright lighting will promote the growth of\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0which will add to the natural feel.","In this kind of environment the fish will show more natural behaviour and can be maintained alongside other\u00a0species\u00a0that enjoy similar conditions.","Although a high level of water movement isn\u2019t essential it\u2019s also proven to thrive in a\u00a0mature\u00a0hill stream-type\u00a0set-up with a rocky\u00a0aquascape. Weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Probably a micropredator feeding on insect larvae and suchlike in nature.","In the aquarium it will accept sinking dried foods but should also be offered regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia, Artemia, bloodworm, etc. A varied diet is the key to maintaining it in the best of health."],"behaviour":["Among the more peaceful members of the genus and an excellent addition to communities of small, stream-dwelling fishes.","Good tankmates include peaceful schooling or shoaling cyprinids\u00a0plus rheophilic loaches such as Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon, Beaufortia or Sewellia spp., and less territorial nemacheilids.","Stream-dwelling gobies from genera including Sicyopterus, Stiphodon, Rhinogobius and Lentipes can also make interesting additions to this kind of community.\u00a0Territorial\u00a0or otherwise\u00a0aggressive bottom-dwellers are less suitable companions.","It does best in the presence of conspecifics and should be kept in a mixed sex group comprising at least half a dozen specimens, preferably 10 or more.","This will allow you to observe some interesting social interactions and the formation of a hierarchy between males. While rivals can be aggressive towards one another this shouldn\u2019t become problematic in a well-structured set-up."],"reproduction":["Several successes have now been recorded but the first was by UK aquarist Mick Wright who obtained his specimens from fellow fishkeeper Andy Rushworth.","Andy had recovered a small number of fry from one of his filters and repeatedly observed spawning behaviour in his wild caught adults, but it appeared that most of the eggs were being consumed.","To remedy this Mick used a small, 30 cm x 15 cm aquarium,\u00a0to the base of which was added plastic under-gravel filter plates with the central, slatted sections removed and replaced with 1mm diameter mesh. On top of this was placed a double layer of glass marbles and an air-powered sponge filter\u00a0was installed (see photo).","Initially a pair of males and three females were added but aggression between the males proved too intense so one was removed and the remaining fish left in the spawning tank overnight before being removed. 98 \u00a0fry were subsequently raised from this first attempt with no particular\u00a0trigger required to induce breeding activity as the fish were already spawning on a daily basis in the stock tank.","The eggs hatched in around 24-36 hours with\u00a0fry free swimming within three days. At this point they were fed Paramecium\u00a0until large enough to accept Artemia nauplii.","Later, chopped Tubifex, grindal worm and crushed flake were introduced to the diet. Subsequent experiences by other hobbyists have shown that this species is prolific for a small fish with up to 300 eggs being deposited in a single spawning event."],"create_time":1426709862.04668}
