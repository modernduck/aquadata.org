from the lower Ganges River basin with type locality given as \u2018ponds and ditches of Bengal\u2019, the latter name used historically in reference to a geographical region now mostly divided between\u00a0country of Bangladesh and the state of West Bengal, India.","It\u2019s generally considered to have an enormous natural range extending from Iran to Taiwan and Bali, with records existing from\u00a0Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.","However there exists significant evidence to suggest that C. gachua as currently understood represents a complex of similar-looking species and a taxonomic review of the group has been pending for a number of years.","Ng et al. (1999) noted the presence of small black spots on the body of Indochinese specimens but not those from India and the Greater Sunda Islands, although Tan and Ng (2005) later observed similar patterning on specimens from Jambi province, Sumatra.","As things stand all populations are referred to as C. gachua\u00a0and included together here except one from Vietnam which has been described as\u00a0Channa longistomata\u00a0(Nguyen et al., 2012), while forms from Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia are sometimes referred to using the invalid name C. limbata (Cuvier, 1831)."],"habitat":["A generalist which has been collected in many different types of habitat although it does tend to avoid very fast-flowing water.","Like others in the genus it can tolerate hypoxic conditions due to its ability to breath atmospheric air (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"maintenance":["Like most smaller Channa species it prefers a dimly-lit aquarium with plenty of cover in the form of live plants, driftwood branches, terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc., arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots.","Surface vegetation such as\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp. is also appreciated and makes the fish less inclined to conceal themselves.","It\u2019s essential to use a tightly-fitting cover since Channa spp. are notorious for their ability to escape, and a gap should be left between this and the water surface as they require access to a layer of humid air."],"diet":["An obligate predator feeding mostly on smaller fishes and insects in nature but in most cases adapting well to dead alternatives in captivity.","Some specimens even accept dried foods although these should never form the staple diet.","Young fish can be offered chironomid larvae (bloodworm), small earthworms, chopped prawn and suchlike while adults will accept strips of fish flesh, whole prawns/shrimp, mussels, live river shrimp, larger earthworms, etc.","This species should not be fed mammalian or avian meat such as beef heart or chicken since some of the lipids contained in these cannot be properly metabolised by the fish and may cause excess fat deposits and even organ degeneration.","Similarly there is no benefit in the use of \u2018feeder\u2019 fish such as livebearers or small goldfish which carry with them the risk of parasite or disease introduction and at any rate tend not have a high nutritional value unless properly conditioned beforehand."],"behaviour":["In general Channa are best-maintained in species-specific aquaria although C. gachua can be kept in a well-chosen community arrangement alongside peaceful, non-territorial tankmates that are too large to be viewed as prey.","Young specimens can be maintained together but usually begin to display aggressive behaviour towards one another as they become sexually mature, although this does vary somewhat depending on the population (see \u2018Distribution\u2019).","If a pair forms they are usually peaceful towards one another but hostile to other conspecifics."],"reproduction":["A mouthbrooder which is bred on a regular basis in captivity.","Females of some populations are known to produce infertile eggs in order to feed the fry once they become free-swimming","Care must be taken not to mix populations as some may hybridise."],"create_time":1426710894.05001}
