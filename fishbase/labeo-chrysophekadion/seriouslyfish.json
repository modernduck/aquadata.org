Once settled\u00a0it will often ascend into midwater to feed and browse the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0that tends to form on rockwork and other solid surfaces."],"behaviour":"This species can be belligerent and aggressively territorial towards conspecifics and similarly-shaped fishes, especially when space is limited.","reproduction":"Breeds on a seasonal basis in nature, at the onset of the wet season. It apparently spawns upstream of shallow sandbars where the eggs settle and hatch as the water begins to rise, with the fry moving into inundated riparian vegetation where they continue to follow the edge of the water as the flooding increases.","create_time":1426712338.22904}
