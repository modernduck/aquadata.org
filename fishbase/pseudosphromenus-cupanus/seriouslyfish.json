Post-spawning the female is normally ejected and the male solely responsible for guarding and tending the eggs.","Incubation is approximately 24-48 hours with the fry free-swimming after 2-3 additional days after which they\u2019re able to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, microworm, etc.","Once the fry are swimming freely they may be consumed by other fish in the aquarium, including their mother, so are best separated and grown on elsewhere."],"create_time":1426713489.24639}
