Other members of the genus are known to enter flooded areas during the rainy season."],"maintenance":["","Provide shelter in the form of water-worn rocks and large pieces of bogwood. Floating plants are preferable, though these may be eaten, along with most other aquatic plants. Powerful and efficient filtration is essential as this is an exceptionally messy fish."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and unfussy. O. laticlavius will accept most foods offered, including pellets, frozen foods and vegetable matter. Ensure the fish receive plenty of the latter, as it is primarily herbivorous in nature."],"behaviour":["","Will eat smaller fish but is generally peaceful with other large fish. Some adults may become very aggressive but this is often due to being kept in an aquarium that is too small. Given plenty of room this fish will usually coexist with tankmates such as knifefish, large barbs, catfish and Loricariids."],"reproduction":["","Not yet reported in aquaria, but probably breeds in a similar fashion to its cousin O. goramy. In that species, the male builds a large nest out of vegetation (including grasses and roots in nature). Spawning occurs in the vicinity of the nest and the eggs are then taken there by the male. The female is chased away at this point. The eggs hatch in 24-36 hours and the fry become free swimming 3-5 days later. The male continues to guard them for 2-3 weeks in the wild but can be removed from the aquarium once the young are free swimming. They are large enough to accept brine shrimp nauplii and powdered flake from the first day. Obviously an enormous aquarium, or perhaps a tropical pond, would be required for any serious breeding attempt."],"create_time":1426713024.88762}
