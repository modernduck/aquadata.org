It occurs both in the middle to lower Rio Negro, as well as between the Rio Japur\u00e1 and Rio Tapaj\u00f3s along the Rio Solim\u00c3\u00b5es and main Amazon river."],"habitat":["","Found in clear water tributaries, often around submerged branches or tree roots."],"maintenance":["","A large roomy aquarium with a sand or gravel substrate and decorated with bogwood and roots is preferred. Leave unplanted as most aquatic plants will be eaten."],"diet":["","Stomach analyses of wild fish have revealed it to be an omnivore existing on a substantial amount of plant matter along with an assortment of invertebrates and even freshwater sponges. However experiments with captive fish suggest it\u2019s primarily herbivorous"],"behaviour":["","Suprisingly peaceful for such a large cichlid. Can be safely housed with smaller fish such as tetras. Ideal tankmates include Angels (altum and scalare), heros, geophagus, satanoperca and the larger characins (headstanders,prochilodus,metynnis).Any tank mates should be able to handle the higher tempratures uaru require."],"reproduction":["","Wild caught Uaru will require water paramaters that mirror their natural habitat(very soft and acidic). Captive bred fish will be less fussy. Spawning accures on a flat rock or peice of bogwood.","Young Uaru will readily feed off the parent fishes\u2019 slime coat, in a manner much the same as Discus."],"create_time":1426714175.8042}
