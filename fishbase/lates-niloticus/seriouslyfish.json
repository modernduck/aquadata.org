It\u2019s present in many major lakes including Lake Victoria, and has been introduced into many African countries as it\u2019s an excellent table fish."],"habitat":["","Lakes, rivers and canals. It can also withstand brackish conditions, with a population thriving in the saline Egyptian lake of Mariout."],"maintenance":["","Speaking hypothetically, decor would not be critical. Obviously, an enormous filtration system would be needed to cope with the massive amounts of biological waste a fish like this produces."],"diet":["","Highly piscivorous in nature, juvenile captive specimens have been known to accept prawns, lancefish etc. An adult fish would need large amounts of whole fish such as trout. Keeping one of these fully fed would certainly be an expensive proposition. Larger specimens should be fed with care as they tend to strike quite savagely when feeding."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful with anything it can\u2019t fit into its mouth. This doesn\u2019t actually leave many species that it can be housed with in the long term though. Young specimens have been successfully cohabited with tankmates such as Cichla sp., Datnioides sp., arowana and tankbusting catfish."],"reproduction":["","Surely impossible in aquaria."],"create_time":1426712410.61071}
