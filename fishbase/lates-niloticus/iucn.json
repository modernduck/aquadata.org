It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for central, eastern, north eastern and western Africa, though in north eastern Africa it is noted that the populations from Lake Chamo of Ethiopia are particularly threatened by overexploitation of the fish. In north Africa, the species was common in the Nile Delta, Lower and upper Egyptian Nile, Lake Wadi El-Rayan and Lake Nasser. However the species is now declining due to overfishing and pollution (Kraiem pers comm. 2007). The rate of decline is unknown and the species could be threatened or even Least Concern. The species is therefore assessed as Data Deficient until more information is available on the status of the species.","assessor":"Azeroual, A., Entsua-Mensah, M., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Ntakimazi, G.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
