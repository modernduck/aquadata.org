This has been a highly valued species in the international aquarium  trade since the 1970s and has been listed on Appendix I of CITES since 1975. There are a number of registered CITES breeders  in Asia and the specimens they produce can be imported into several  nations. Other nations restrict or prohibit possession of this species. Illegal trade does occur. Habitat degradation throughout the species' range, caused by a variety of  human activities, is now its main threat. For example, a number of swamp habitats have been transformed into agricultural land. Areas of forested  habitat have been logged and transformed into plantations. Forest fires  have impacted most of the species range in Indonesia, especially peat  swamp forests. This species is assessed as Endangered based on a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality, and levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Further taxonomic study is required to confirm the taxonomic status of populations of the species across its range.","assessor":"Kottelat, M.","evaluator":"Juffe Bignoli, D. & Vidthayanon, C."}]
