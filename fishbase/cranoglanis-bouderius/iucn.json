However, once common, the species has declined by at least 50% in the last twenty years, but within the past three generations (around 10 years) the species is estimated to have decline by more than 30% (K. Cui and H. Zhou pers. comm. 2011) due to overfishing and other threats, and it is expected that the decline is likely to continue due to ongoing fishing pressure and increasing levels of pollution and habitat loss. It is assessed as Vulnerable based on the past and ongoing inferred decline.","assessor":"Cui, K. & Zhao, H.","evaluator":"Allen, D.J., Zhou, W. & Chen, X.-Y."}]
