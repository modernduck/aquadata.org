Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting but you can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum or Cryptocoryne spp., while floating vegetation, especially Ceratopteris spp., is also useful.","There is no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","It goes without saying that this species is sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria."],"diet":["Chiefly a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0with\u00a0the stomach contents of wild specimens from Guyana observed to comprise\u00a0Ephemeroptera larvae, copepods and ostracods.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it may learn to accept dried foods of a suitable size but should ideally be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species but does not always make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its rather timid nature and predominantly benthic existence.","Ideally it should be maintained alone or with comparably-sized, non-aggressive\u00a0characids and relatives plus smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","Nuptial adult males are territorial to an extent but physical damage is rare\u00a0provided the d\u00e9cor is arranged in such a way that plenty of broken lines-of-sight are provided."],"reproduction":["Normally spawns in small caves or among leaf litter and forms temporary pair bonds with the male solely responsible for egg and brood-care.","Sexually-active males form small, temporary territories at the centre of which is a small cave normally formed from leaf litter in nature, although in aquaria any suitable structure may be chosen (see \u2018Maintenance\u2019).","They then attempt to attract females in the vicinity to enter the cave via spectacular fin displays.","Eggs are normally attached to the roof of the chosen \u2018cave\u2019 with the female ejected post-spawning.","Inexperienced individuals may eat their first few broods, but don\u2019t be tempted to remove the eggs and hatch them artificially, as the presence of the male seems to be crucial to success.","Incubation is normally 36-48 hours with the fry free-swimming around 4-6 days later.","The male continues to guard them diligently during this period. Once they are free swimming the fry can be offered newly hatched brine shrimp and/or microworm. The adult fish are usually safe with the fry, but watch them carefully for signs of predation if you decide to leave them together."],"create_time":1426711419.13421}
