It is present in Lake Tanganyika."],"habitat":["","A predominantly benthic species inhabiting lakes and rivers."],"maintenance":["","Not a good choice for the planted setup, as it will munch most greenery. Furnish the tank with smooth rocks and driftwood branches instead. Sand or gravel can be used as substrate. If you want to try some plants, use species such as Anubias or Bolbitis, as most fish leave these alone. A little water flow is appreciated. It\u2019s an excellent jumper, so the tank must have a tightly-fitting, heavy cover."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and will accept most foods offered. It should be fed a decent proportion of vegetable matter to keep it in the best of health. A diet of live and frozen foods such as earthworms, prawn and mussel, along with frozen peas (remove the shells), Spirulina flake and blanched spinach would provide the desired balance."],"behaviour":["","Somewhat unpredictable. While some specimens remain peaceful with similarly-sized species, others can become very spiteful as they mature. Certainly don\u2019t attempt to keep one of these with much smaller or shy species. Tankmates in a big tank could include bichirs, large characins, cyprinids, catfish and Loricariids. ","Similarly, while juvenile specimens will shoal together peacefully, they become increasingly aggressive towards one another as they grow. An enormous tank would be needed in order to keep a group of adults."],"reproduction":["","Not known to have been bred in captivity."],"create_time":1426711618.47904}
