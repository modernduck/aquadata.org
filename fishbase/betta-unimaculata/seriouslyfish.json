These areas are very remote and some accessible only by small boat.","Populations from different localities have been observed to exhibit differences in colouration and patterning and these should never be kept together in aquaria as they will undoubtedly hybridise.","In order to maintain accuracy and preserve pure bloodlines the fish are often labelled with the collection locality by collectors/enthusiasts e.g. Mahakam, Sandakan, etc. The fish from \u2018Tawau\u2019 which was initially thought to be B. unimaculata has now been described and named B. ocellata (Tan & Ng 2005)."],"habitat":["Has been collected from numerous\u00a0habitat-types including clear, flowing streams and isolated, elevated pools around headwaters as well as more\u00a0turbid\u00a0forested streams.","In flowing headwaters and streams the fish tend to lurk in slow-moving or stagnant pools whereas in the forest streams they\u2019re found among\u00a0marginal\u00a0vegetation, leaf litter and submerged tree roots.","One population inhabits the top of a rainforest waterfall (in a place named Bahulak we\u2019ve been unable to locate on a map) with\u00a0substrate\u00a0composed of exposed sandstone."],"maintenance":["Can be maintained in a fully-decorated\u00a0aquarium\u00a0although many\u00a0breeders prefer not to use a substrate for ease of maintenance. Driftwood roots and branches can be used and placed such a way that a few shady spots are formed.","If you can\u2019t find driftwood of the desired shape common beech or oak is safe to use if thoroughly dried and stripped of bark. Clay plant pots or lengths of piping can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of dried leaf litter, with beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves all suitable, can further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry\u00a0and the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial.","Like others in the\u00a0genus\u00a0this\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting. You could add aquatic plant\u00a0species\u00a0that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum pteropus,\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri\u00a0or perhaps some potted\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., and a few patches of floating vegetation would be useful to diffuse the light entering the\u00a0tank.","Filtration need not be too strong, with an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0set to turn over gently adequate. Keep the\u00a0tank\u00a0well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an\u00a0excellent jumper."],"diet":"Likely to prey on insects and other small invertebrates/zooplankton\u00a0in nature.\u00a0Captive fish\u00a0will normally accept dried products once they\u2019re recognised as edible, but should be offered plenty of small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0regularly to ensure development of optimal colour and condition. Large specimens can be offered the occasional earthworm, but take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. seem particularly prone to obesity.","behaviour":["Not recommended for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon. It\u2019s requirements and disposition mean it\u2019s best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate and outcompete it. Some small cyprinids and loaches that inhabit similar environments in nature are compatible.","It\u2019s best maintained in a pair if you wish to breed it, but a group could be maintained in a sufficiently large aquarium."],"reproduction":["Paternal mouthbrooder. Ideally organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes, unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","Though not always possible, the ideal way to obtain a compatible pair for breeding purposes is to allow one to form naturally from a group. If a male and female are selected randomly they do not always coexist peacefully and the weaker individual may even be killed. Once a pair has formed they do not usually display any aggression unless space is restricted.","Courtship is normally a protracted affair during which the intensely-coloured male approaches the female with mouth gaping and fins erect. The female usually orientates her body so that the male is facing one of her flanks and may\u00a0gape\u00a0and\u00a0flare\u00a0in response.","Eggs and milt are released in small batches during an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female, and there may be several\u00a0\u2018dummy\u2019 attempts before spawning commences.\u00a0Both adults have been observed to collect fertilised eggs, with those picked up by the female spat into the mouth of the male.\u00a0\u00a0Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth the cycle is repeated until the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0which can take some time.","Post-spawning\u00a0it is very important to give the male as much peace and quiet as possible. Males are notorious for swallowing broods of eggs after a few days and the chances of this happening increase if the male is unduly disturbed.","For this reason many breeders leave the female\u00a0in situ\u00a0rather than risk unsettling the male by removing her though in smaller aquaria, in particular, she may harass the male excessively or eat fry and require removal regardless.","The incubation period is 10-14 days at the end of which the male will begin to release fully-formed, free-swimming\u00a0fry. Success in raising them has been had when removed, left alongside the male or both adults.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are big enough (5mm+) to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0(see above notes on the feeding of\u00a0Artemia\u00a0to young\u00a0Betta) immediately. Feed them small amounts of different foods several times per day for the best rate of growth but be very careful not to overfeed as young of this\u00a0species\u00a0can develop intestinal problems very easily if overfed. Small (5 \u2013 10% of\u00a0tank\u00a0volume) daily water changes should also be introduced to prevent\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes accumulating."],"create_time":1426710628.37491}
