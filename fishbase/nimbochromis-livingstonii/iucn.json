The main threat to this species is overfishing. A local decline in fishery catches is recorded for the southern parts of the lake, and Lake Malombe, possibly due to the commercial trawl fishery, but the population is widespread throughout the rest of Lake Malawi where the trawl fishery is absent. Overall this species is assessed as Least Concern.","assessor":"Kazembe, J., Makocho, P. & Mailosi, A.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J. (Freshwater Fish Red List Authority) & Darwall, W.
