It\u2019s usually found sheltering among roots or submerged vegetation."],"maintenance":["","It\u2019s a shy, nocturnal species so it\u2019s best to keep the tank dimly lit. Provide plenty of hiding places in the form of clay flowerpots, lengths of plastic piping, tangles of driftwood etc. Plants aren\u2019t essential but are useful in cutting out the amount of light hitting the bottom of the tank and providing extra cover. ","If you buy one of these for your community tank you\u2019ll probably find it will head straight for an area of cover and remain there during the hours of daylight. If you want to see it more often, consider installing a red light above the tank. It can\u2019t see red lightwaves, so if you switch this on at night you should be able to observe it foraging for food. It usually becomes much bolder as it grows, and adult specimens will often cruise the tank whether the lights are on or not."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and easy to feed. Use a good quality sinking pellet or tablet as the staple diet. Supplement this with live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, small earthworms and similar. It\u2019s best to add food after lights out to ensure it gets its share."],"behaviour":["","Totally unaggressive but it will eat smaller fish so isn\u2019t really suitable for the general community. It can be kept with most peaceable species that are too big too be considered food, including medium-sized characins, cyprinids, anabantoids, livebearers, cichlids and other non-territorial catfish. ","It\u2019s tolerant of conspecifics and a group can usually be kept without any problems. If several are present they\u2019ll often share the same refuge during the day. While some jostling for position might occur, no physical damage is usually done."],"reproduction":["","There are no reports of breeding in the hobby. Apparently in nature it spawns amongst surface vegetation."],"create_time":1426713301.97498}
