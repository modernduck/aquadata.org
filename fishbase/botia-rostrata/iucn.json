Population estimates in Arunachal Pradesh records a decline of more than 60% in five years (Tamang <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span>  2007). Extrapolating this information for rest of the range areas where the threats are similar, it is inferred that the species may have undergone more than 30% decline in its entire population. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable. If records from the Irrawaddy and Salween basins in southern China are confirmed (and found in Myanmar) , the species should most likley be assessed as Least Concern, unless there is supporting evidence of population declines in these areas as well.","assessor":"Chaudhry, S.","evaluator":"Rema Devi, K.R., Arunachalam, M., Dahanukar, N., Vishwanath, W., Daniel, B.A. & Molur, S."}]
