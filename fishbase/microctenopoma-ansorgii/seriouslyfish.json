The tank should be well-covered as these fish are great escape artists."],"diet":["","Provide a diet consisting mainly of small frozen or live food. Rarely accepts dried foods."],"behaviour":["","This is quite a slow-moving fish and will easily be out-competed by more boisterous species at feeding time, so is best kept with small, peaceful species that inhabit the upper and lower parts of the tank such as hatchetfish, lampeyes, corydoras and small loricariids. We believe it is stunning enough to deserve a species tank, in which it will do best. Males may be aggressive to one another, particularly if spawning."],"reproduction":["","Possible but tricky. Bubblenester. A dimly-lit, well-planted aquarium with lots of floating plants and soft, acidic water is required to spawn these fish. Condition them with live food. The male will build a very small, loose bubblenest of large bubbles amongst floating vegetation or under a broad leaf. Spawning occurs under the nest in a typical anabantoid embrace. Up to 600 eggs may be laid, which hatch in around 24 hours and become free-swimming in 2-3 days. It is best to remove the parents after hatching. The fry are tiny and should be fed infusoria for the first week, after which they will accept brine shrimp nauplii."],"create_time":1426712695.12125}
