{"images":[],"distribution":["","Probably endemic to the River Cross drainage in Cameroon."],"habitat":["","Most commonly found in shady, slow-moving rainforest streams with lush growths of overhanging marginal vegetation."],"maintenance":["","Assume tank setup as for other bichir species. Therefore floor space is more important than depth. A soft substrate with pieces of driftwood and smooth rocks arranged to form hiding places is ideal. Some floating vegetation should also be provided. Plants are not essential but are appreciated. The aquarium should have a tight-fitting cover as bichirs are excellent escape artists."],"diet":["","P. teugelsi is carnivorous by nature and feeding should be as for other species in the genus. This means that dried foods are unlikely to be accepted and instead the fish should be offered meaty live or frozen foods such as prawns, earthworms, mussel, lancefish etc"],"behaviour":["","Not to be trusted with tankmates it can fit in its mouth but is probably relatively peaceful otherwise as with other bichirs. Suitable tankmates should therefore include other Polypterus species, Synodontis, Datnoides, Knife Fish, larger Ctenopoma species, medium to large characins and African Butterfly Fish."],"reproduction":["","Has not been bred in aquaria. Little to nothing is known of its breeding behaviour."],"create_time":1426713383.39329}
