This species is reported from the lower reaches of Brahmaputra river in India and from one other recent location&#160;much further to the west in Assam. It is possible that this species is more widely present within the area and might eventually qualify for Least Concern if more information is available from surveys and research.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N.","evaluator":"Britz, R., Dey, S.C., Jha, B.R., Vishwanath, W. & Allen, D.J."}]
