Apart from coloration, it is distinguished from the latter two species on the basis of slight differences in overlapping features. From <em>M. stormsi</em>, it is distinguished on the basis of greater number of scales in the longitudinal series (25-27, vs. 22-24 in <em>M. stormsi</em>) and from <em>M. sardina</em> by a slightly greater head length (26-29% SL, vs. 24-27% SL in <em>M. sardina</em>). Furthermore, the presence of dark pigmentation along the base of the flank scales, considered by Poll (1967) and others as characteristic of <em>M. humilis</em>, was observed to be variably preserved in the material examined in this study. These species are distributed broadly in the Congo basin and material referable to all three was observed in the Lower Guinea region. However, such small differences are of dubious diagnostic utility in light of insufficient knowledge of intraspecific and geographic variation in these species. At present, it seems most reasonable to refer all to the older available name, <em>M. humilis</em>.","rationale":"This species has a wide distribution, with no known major widespread threats. It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for central Africa. In western Africa, this species has wide distribution within Nigeria and Chad. As it is only known from five locations it might qualify as Vulnerable D2. However, as one of the locations is subject to active protection (Cross River National Park) it is assessed as Near Threatened.","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Olaosebikan, B.D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
