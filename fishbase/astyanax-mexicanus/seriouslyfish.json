The blind form occurs only in underground caves and caverns","maintenance":"Being blind, the fish does not require any specific decor or form of cover, and can be kept in most types of setup. Plants are not harmed, as obviously they don\u2019t feature in its natural waters. Alternatively, you could choose to organise a cave-style tank for it, with tall rocks or slate pieces placed along the back and sides of the tank, smaller rocks in the centre and a dark substrate. Lit with a dim, perhaps red or blue light tube this kind of set-up can look very effective.","diet":"Its captive diet should comprise quality dried products alongside plenty of small live and frozen foods.","behaviour":"Hardy and peaceful, it\u2019s actually an excellent choice for the beginner and suitable for most community aquaria, though very shy or sluggish tankmates are best-avoided. It sometimes nips at tankmates when feeding, but this is more attributable to its searching technique than aggression. Although it can\u2019t be described as gregarious it doesn seem to fare better when maintained in a group and we suggest the purchase of at least four individuals.","reproduction":["Quite easily-bred provided a few simple requirements are met. A?\u00a0layer of mesh or similar should be suspended around 1/2\u2033 above the tank base?\u00a0in order to?\u00a0prevent predation of the eggs by the adults, and a?\u00a0simple air-powered sponge filter can also be installed.?\u00a0It\u2019s best to condition the sexes in separate tanks so as to avoid any unwanted spawning events.","The most well-comditioned male and female can then be removed and placed?\u00a0in the spawning tank in the evening. They should have spawned by the following morning. If eggs are visible, remove the adults immediately. If you still can\u2019t see any eggs after 24 hours or so, remove them and try a different pair.","This is a prolific species and up to 1000 eggs may be laid per female. These are white and initially may appear infertile but hatch quickly, in around 24 hours, with the fry requiring a further 5-7 days to absorb the yolk sac and become free swimming 5. Infusoria or other microscopic food should then be offered for the first week or so, after which Artemia?\u00a0nauplii?\u00a0or suitably-sized dried products can be introduced to the diet. Some predation may occur within the brood, but with the amount of fry?\u00a0produced this should not present a problem.","Interestingly, the fry?\u00a0appear to have normal eyes in the early stages of life but these never develop fully and eventually recede completely, becoming covered with flesh."],"create_time":1426710324.56206}
