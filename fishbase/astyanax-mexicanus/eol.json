Mexican tetras can form large schools, up to several hundred individuals.  These fish prefer sandy or rocky bottomed pools, but they are found in a diversity of habitats, including fast-moving water. <i>Astyanax mexicana</i> is carnivorous, eating insects and small fish, some populations also also eat plants and green algae.  Previously considered a subspecies of <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, it is now classified as its own species, and it may represent a species complex.  The Mexican tetra is found in two distinct forms depending on its environment: a silver, surface dwelling form, and about 30 distinct populations of a cave-dwelling form morphologically distinct from the normal form by pronounced loss of pigmentation and eyes.  The cave form is thought to be derived from two distinct lineages, implying that these morphological features were lost convergently.  <i>Astyanax mexicana</i> has been much studied as a genetic model for adaptations to darkness and eye development and evolution, especially powerful because this species is closely related to another well-known laboratory model, the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>).  Both the regular and cave form of the Mexican tetra are common and popular aquarium fish, easily bred in captivity.  \r\n\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~tbonner/txfishes/astyanax%20mexicanus.htm\">Hassan-Williams and Bonner</a>; Dowling, Martasian and Jeffrey 2002; <a href=\"http://www.fishbase.org/summary/speciessummary.php?id=2740\">Froese 2010</a>; <a href=\"http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=417\">Nico 2012</a>; Protas et al. 2007; Retaux, Pottin and Alunni 2008; <a href=\"%E2%80%9Chttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mexican_tetra&amp;oldid=473006765%E2%80%9D\">Wikipedia 2012</a>)","agents":[{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"provider"}],"references":["Carla Hassan-Williams and Timothy H.

It is primarily a carnivorous fish, feeding on aquatic insects, crustaceans, worms, snails and smaller fish (2) (5), but it is also reported to feed on plant matter and algae (5).&nbsp;In Texas, breeding activity has been observed in the surface-dwelling form from late April until September, although elsewhere, such as the lower reaches of the Rio Grande River, reproduction is said to occur year-round.  Spawning taking place in late spring and early summer, when a mass of sticky eggs is released into the surrounding waters (5).  Mexican tetras develop quickly, which relates to their short lifespan.  Those that are born in the spring reproduce for the first time in autumn, and few live for longer than two years (5).&nbsp;<b>Threats</b>&nbsp;The Mexican tetra is not believed to be in danger of extinction (5).  However, a lack of clarification on the taxonomy of <i>Astyanax</i> species (8) makes it hard to determine the status of this fish and what threats it may face.

One form is a surface-dwelling fish, silvery in colour with a black band that extends along each side to the tail (4) (5).  The tail and lower fins of some individuals may be tinted yellow or red (4).  The other form has evolved to inhabit caves, which has resulted in a loss of colouration and, most significantly, the loss of functioning eyes (3) (6).  Both forms of the Mexican tetra have a forked tail, a small dorsal fin (4), and an anal fin that, on breeding males, possesses tiny hooks (5).  It has comparatively large and strong teeth (4) (5).  Much confusion exists over the correct taxonomy of the Mexican tetra, with some scientists believing that the surface-dwelling and cave forms are actually different species (7) (8).","agents":[{"full_name":"ARKive","homepage":"http://www.arkive.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"aca792eb8a2c48d7f7d0c2db72693df9","dataObjectVersionID":8586199,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","mimeType":"text/html","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rightsHolder":"FishWise Professional","source":"http://www.fishwisepro.com/Species/details.aspx?Zoom=True&SId=44097","description":"Mexico; Texas and New Mexico, southern U.S.A., Guatemala.","agents":[{"full_name":"FishWise Professional","homepage":"http://www.fishwisepro.com","role":"project"},{"full_name":"FishWise Professional","homepage":"http://www.fishwisepro.com/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"0733c145230159a90eb1c99fcb749eb9","dataObjectVersionID":6694953,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Distribution","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Range","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rights":"Copyright Wildscreen 2003-2008","rightsHolder":"Wildscreen","audience":"General public","source":"http://www.arkive.org/mexican-tetra/astyanax-mexicanus/","description":"The Mexican tetra occurs in eastern and central Mexico (2) and in Texas and New Mexico in the United States (4).

(A) Each fish was photographed from the right side to visualize the entire head or a region just posterior to the orbit of the eye (red rectangle). Each individual was also genotyped for the polymorphic region of Mc1r ORF housing the fixed 2-bp deletion found in members of the Pach\u00f3n cave.

(D\u2013F) The heterozygous individual demonstrates roughly the same number of melanophores, however each cell appears to produce less eumelanin. (G\u2013I) A non-albino F2 individual with two copies of the Pach\u00f3n allele of Mc1r demonstrates the least amount of pigmentation compare to other pigmented genotypes, however this individual clearly differs from (J) albino phenotypes.
