Should be maintained in a \u00a0group of at least 4-6 individuals.","reproduction":["Can be bred in a similar fashion to many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species.","Use a ratio of 2 males per female if possible, and when the females are visibly full of eggs perform a large (50-70%) water change with cooler water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare-bottomed arrangement."],"create_time":1426711137.81985}
