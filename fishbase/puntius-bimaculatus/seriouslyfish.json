The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced, and\u00a0spawning\u00a0should take place the following morning.","An alternative is to spawn the fish in a group with half a dozen specimens of each\u00a0sex\u00a0being a good number, although a larger aquarium may be necessary.","In either situation the adults will probably eat the eggs given the chance and should be removed as soon as any are noticed.","These should hatch in 24 \u2013 48 hours with the\u00a0fry\u00a0free swimming around 24 hours later.","They should be fed on an infusoria-grade food for the first few days until large enough to accept microworm, Artemia nauplii, or suchlike."],"create_time":1426713557.72402}
