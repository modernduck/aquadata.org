Its projected extent of occurrence (EOO) is between 14,000 and 16,000 km\u00b2 and it occurs in 4-10 locations. Even though the species is common in some areas of its distribution its global population status is unknown. The species is threatened due to habitat alteration due to deforestation and  intensive agriculture activities in the catchment areas, industrial,  agricultural and domestic pollution, and sand  mining. Collection of the species for the aquarium trade could also be a potential threat to the species.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N. & Rema Devi, K.R.","evaluator":"Raghavan, R., Ali, A. & Molur, S."}]
