{"images":{"src":"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Synodontis-dhonti-288x192.jpg"},"distribution":["","This species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika."],"habitat":["","Naturally inhabits deep water areas upto at least 100 metres where there is very little light. For this reason, dhonti will be more active in the aquarium in lower light conditions or in tanks where plenty of cover is available."],"maintenance":["","Should be housed in a Lake Tanganyika biotope setup, with piles of rocks arranged to form caves and areas of open water for swimming. Dim lighting will encourage the fish to be seen more often; otherwise ensure there is plenty of cover for these fish in the form of rocky areas and caves as previously mentioned."],"diet":["","Synodontis are omnivorous and are most unfussy in terms of feeding. Frozen, live and dried foods are all accepted. It also relishes vegetable matter in the form of shelled peas, cucumber etc., which it will rasp at with the teeth in its lower jaw."],"behaviour":["","Should not be kept with any fish so small as to be considered food but makes a good addition to a community of larger hard water cichlids, ideally of Tanganyikan origin. It is territorial with conspecifics and a group would require a suitably large tank."],"reproduction":["","Not recorded in aquaria. It is known to spawn in open water in nature and is an egg scatterer exhibiting no parental care."],"create_time":1426713941.22048}
