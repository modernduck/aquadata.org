(2009) conducted a phylogeographic analysis of rio Negro populations and found those inhabiting the upper part of the basin to represent genetically distinct lineages of far older origin than those in the middle basin.","As a result six populations from the tributary headwaters\u00a0Vaup\u00e9s,\u00a0Padu\u00e1, Mari\u00e9, Curicuriari, Ferrinha and\u00a0Tea, respectively, were recommended for conservation priority due to their genetic uniqueness."],"habitat":["A more-or-less exclusive inhabitant of forest streams and minor tributaries containing relatively slowly-moving water.","In the rio Negro system it inhabits so-called igap\u00f3 and igarap\u00e9 habitats\u00a0characterised by thick, often overhanging, riparian vegetation and substrates covered in fallen branches, tree roots and leaf litter.","The water is typically acidic, of negligible carbonate hardness and conductivity and\u00a0stained brownish due to the presence of humic substances released by decomposing organic matter.","In the Orinoco system it\u2019s more commonly-associated with habitats known as morichals\u00a0which tend to contain transparent, clear water and sandy substrates, often with dense growth of aquatic plants or riparian vegetation among which the fish take shelter.","Although the water is acidic it is less so than in the Negro with typical values of 5.5-6.5.","Both types of habitat are highly-seasonal in nature and during the dry season the fish tend to form large schools in the main stream channels, among the layer of leaf litter and other organic detritus which forms due to the lack of flow.","When the wet season rains begin water depth and flow increases and the streams flood the surrounding terrain.","The leaf litter tends to disperse, exposing the underlying sand, and the fish swim higher in the water column, moving into areas of inundated vegetation or taking cover among submerged roots (Mikolji, 2009).","This seasonal hydrological cycle also permits mixing of cardinal tetra populations that would otherwise remain isolated from one another.","In nature P. axelrodi is considered a virtually annual fish with individuals over a year old rarely-encountered, although it can live considerably longer in aquaria.","It occurs alongside hundreds of other species but some of those occurring in the R\u00edo Orinoco and available in the aquarium trade include Corydoras delphax, Platydoras costatus, Baryancistrus beggini, Hypancistrus inspector, Panqolus maccus, Panaque nigrolineatus, Hemigrammus rhodostomus, H. stictus, Hyphessobrycon sweglesi, Pristella maxillaris, Copella nattereri, Biotodoma wavrini, Geophagus dicrozoster, Heros severus, Mesonauta insignis, Satanoperca daemon and Uaru fernandezyepezi, for example."],"maintenance":["Maintenance generally presents few problems although a degree of care is necessary with wild specimens which are more intolerant of deteriorating water conditions than commercially-produced fish.","It perhaps looks best\u00a0in a heavily-planted set-up or\u00a0natural-style arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry and the humic substances released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial, with alder cones also useful in this respect.","There\u2019s no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting but you can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, such as\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also appreciated."],"diet":["Likely to be omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae, Daphnia, Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Generally peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It\u2019s perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle."],"reproduction":["You\u2019ll need to set up a dedicated\u00a0tank\u00a0if you want to raise decent numbers of\u00a0fry. This should be very dimly lit and contain clumps of fine-leaved plants such as java moss or\u00a0spawning\u00a0mops, to give the fish somewhere to deposit their eggs.","Alternatively you could cover the\u00a0base\u00a0of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with some kind of mesh. This should be of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through it, but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The water should be soft and\u00a0acidic\u00a0in the range\u00a0pH\u00a05.5-6.5,\u00a0gH\u00a01-5, with a temperature of around 80-84\u00b0F.","A small air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0bubbling away very gently is all that is needed in terms of filtration.","It can be spawned in a group, with half a dozen specimens of each\u00a0sex\u00a0being a good number. Condition these with plenty of small live foods and\u00a0spawning\u00a0shouldn\u2019t present too many problems.","The adults can be removed once eggs are noticed, or in a very heavily planted\u00a0tank\u00a0left\u00a0in situ\u00a0and\u00a0fry\u00a0siphoned from the\u00a0tank\u00a0as they\u2019re noticed.","In terms of productivity, it\u2019s best spawned in pairs. Under this technique the fish are conditioned in male and female groups in separate tanks, or via the use of a\u00a0tank\u00a0divider.","When the females are noticeably full of eggs and the males are displaying their best colours, select the fattest female and best-coloured male and transfer them to the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0in the evening.","They should\u00a0spawn\u00a0during the night, often around midnight, have been observed to do so even if the aquarium lights are switched on, and exhibit their night-time colour pattern throughout.","If no eggs have appeared after a couple of days remove them and try a different\u00a0pair.","In either situation the adults will eat the eggs given the chance and should be removed as soon as eggs are noticed. These will hatch in 24-36 hours, with the\u00a0fry\u00a0becoming free swimming a 3-4 days later.","They should be fed on an\u00a0infusoria-type\u00a0food for the first few days, until they\u2019re large enough to accept\u00a0microworm\u00a0or\u00a0brine shrimp\u00a0nauplii.","The eggs and fry are light sensitive in the early stages of life and the tank should be kept in darkness if possible."],"create_time":1426713125.76091}
