Its distribution is somewhat unclear, however, not least because there exist problems with its identification (see \u2018Notes\u2019). For example, it may also occur in\u00a0the \u2018Tres Fronteras\u2019 region\u00a0further east, where\u00a0similar-looking fish have been collected around the borders between Peru, Brazil and Colombia.","Type locality is \u2018Chancho Ca\u00f1o, near Pebas, 3\u00b010\u2019S, 71\u00b046\u2019W, Amazon River system, Loreto, Peru\u2019."],"habitat":"Observations of wild fish suggest that this species prefers smaller, quiet tributaries with clear, acidic water (pH ~5.0-5.5) substrates of fine sand and leaf litter, and extensive riparian vegetation.","maintenance":["Ideally use a substrate of fine sand, although rounded gravel is an acceptable alternative provided that it is kept scrupulously clean.","Other d\u00e9cor is largely down to personal choice, but some cover should be provided to give the fish security."],"diet":["Corydoras\u00a0spp. are foraging omnivores and most species will accept\u00a0good quality,\u00a0sinking dried foods, as well as small live and frozen varieties such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex, etc.","C. fowleri is among the pickier species and may refuse to accept dried foods, however, while newly-imported wild fish are often\u00a0infested with internal parasites and require constant access to live foods in order to maintain body weight during the acclimatisation period.","Under no circumstances should they be expected to survive on \u2018left-overs\u2019 from other inhabitants of the aquarium or relied on to \u2018clean\u2019 the aquarium."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with the majority of other fishes, but males in particular can be aggressive towards conspecifics and other similarly-shaped species. This behaviour is most pronounced when the fish are reproductively active and males are competing for female attention.","It is thus suitable only for larger community aquaria, and should be maintained in a pair or group comprising at least 4-6 individuals."],"reproduction":["Can be bred in a similar fashion to many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species, although it may be preferable to use pairs of adults rather than a mixed group in order to minimise aggression.","When the female is noticeably gravid\u00a0perform a large (50-70%) water change with cooler water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare arrangement."],"create_time":1426711182.76318}
