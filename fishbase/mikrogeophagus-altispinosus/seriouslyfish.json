species appears endemic to the upper rio Madeira basin in Bolivia and Brazil.","Records exist from the R\u00edo Mamor\u00e9 and R\u00edo Guapor\u00e9 drainages in Bolivia (where the Guapor\u00e9 is known as the It\u00e9nez)\u00a0and Brazil plus the upper R\u00edo Orthon (r\u00edos\u00a0\u00a0Tahuamanu and Manuripi).","Type locality is \u2018sand-bank in the\u00a0Rio Marmor\u00e9, below the mouth of the Rio Guapor\u00e9\u2019 with some of the type series also \u2018taken in a large lake near San Joaquin, Bolivia\u2019."],"habitat":["Little information is available but presumably inhabits tributaries, marginal zones, oxbows and lakes with substrates of sand or mud.","The upper Madeira system is spectacularly diverse with more than 400 freshwater fish species reported to date.","Some of those known in the aquarium hobby include Aphyocharax alburnus, Gymnocorymbus ternetzi,\u00a0Hemigrammus lunatus, H. ocellifer, Hyphessobrycon agulha, H. bentosi, H. serpae, Moenkhausia colletti, Thayeria boehlkei, Tyttocharax tambopatensis, Carnegiella striata,\u00a0Gasteropelecus sternicla, Nannostomus trifasciatus, Pyrrhulina australe, Brochis splendens, Corydoras acutus, C. hastatus, Rineloricaria spp., Pseudohemiodon spp., Apistogramma linkei, Biotodoma cupido, Geophagus megasema,\u00a0Mesonauta festivus\u00a0and\u00a0Satanoperca jurupari."],"maintenance":["The most essential addition is a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0so that the fish can browse naturally (see \u2018Diet\u2019).","Coarser options such as\u00a0gravel\u00a0or small pebbles can inhibit feeding, damage\u00a0gill\u00a0filaments and even be ingested with the potential of internal damage or blockages.","Other d\u00e9cor can consist of\u00a0wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed, plus one or two flat rocks or similar to provide potential spawning sites.","Aquatic plants can also be used with those from genera such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0perhaps most useful since they can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Filtration, or at least water flow, should not be excessive and very large water changes are best avoided with regular changes of 10-15% recommended.","It goes without saying that this species should never be added to new or otherwise biologically immature aquaria.","When conditions deteriorate it becomes susceptible to a condition similar to that referred to as\u00a0\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or hole-in the-head in other species which initially manifests itself as small pits formed by eroding flesh around the head and lateral line pores."],"diet":["Mikrogeophagus\u00a0spp. are\u00a0benthophagous\u00a0by nature, normally taking mouthfuls of\u00a0substrate\u00a0which are sifted for edible items with the remaining material expelled via the gill openings and mouth, although they will also browse solid surfaces and snatch items directly from the water column.","In the aquarium they should be offered a variety of live and frozen fare such as bloodworm,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0Daphnia, grindal worm, etc. supplemented by good quality, sinking dried foods of a suitably small size.","Wild fish may initially refuse the latter but normally learn to accept them over time.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife."],"behaviour":["Despite normally being sold as such\u00a0M. altispinosus\u00a0is not recommended for the general community aquarium since it requires pristine water quality and is a poor competitor, although that\u2019s not to say it must be maintained alone.","Groups of peaceful, open water-dwelling characids or similar are particularly recommended tankmates since\u00a0the presence of small schooling or shoaling fishes appears to be used as an indicator that there is no immediate threat in the vicinity and therefore can help reduce its natural shyness.","Peaceful bottom-dwellers such as Corydoras spp. catfishes can also be included and many smaller loricariids are also suitable."],"reproduction":["This species is a biparental substrate spawner and is best bred in a dedicated set-up with no other fishes present.","There doesn\u2019t appear to be any particular trigger for the\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0with the main requirements being good diet and stringent maintenance regime.","Unless sexable adults are available it\u2019s best to begin with a group of young fish and allow pairs to form naturally.","The eggs are normally laid on a solid surface such as a flat rock, piece of driftwood, broad plant leaf or directly on the aquarium glass, and spawning\u00a0occurs in typical style with the female laying one or more rows of eggs before the male moves in to fertilise them, this\u00a0process\u00a0being repeated numerous times.","Inexperienced pairs may eat their brood but often get things right after a few attempts."],"create_time":1426712712.4758}
