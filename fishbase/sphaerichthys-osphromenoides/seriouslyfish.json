In the latter records exist from throughout the Malaysian state of Sarawak and Indonesian province of West Kalimantan (Kalimantan Barat).","It\u2019s also known from Singapore though this population may now have been extirpated. Some populations exhibit differences in colouration, particularly in the unpaired fins which may appear more blueish or reddish depending on population, and/or fin morphology, with males of some forms possessing more deeply-forked caudal and/or more extended dorsal and anal fins."],"habitat":["Mostly inhabits peat swamps and associated black water streams though is also found in some clear water habitats. The former are located in forested areas and contain water that is typically stained dark brown by humic acids and other chemicals released from decaying organic material.","This results in a negligible dissolved mineral content and the pH can drop as low as 3.0 or 4.0. The dense rainforest canopy above means that very little light penetrates the water surface and the substrate is normally littered with fallen tree branches and rotting leaves.","The clear water habitats are broadly simlar in terms of water chemistry but in many cases aquatic vegetation grows profusely and often includes representatives of genera such as Cryptocoryne, Blyxa, Barclaya, Eleocharis, Utricularia, and Lymnophila.","At habitat #1 in the images above S. osphromenoides was collected alongside Trigonopoma pauciperforatum, Luciocephalus pulcher, and Nandus nebulosus, while at habitat #2 sympatric species included Rasbora einthovenii, Boraras maculatus, Belontia hasselti, Betta waseri, B. tussyae, B. imbellis, and Kryptopterus macrocephalus.","Unfortunately due to logging, agriculture and other human activities throughout Southeast Asia vast tracts of primary forest have been altered or lost entirely. Fish habitats in affected regions have also been heavily-modified in many cases with species diversity declining as a result."],"maintenance":["Provided adequate cover and structure is available this\u00a0species\u00a0is unfussy with regards to d\u00e9cor with ceramic flowerpots, lengths of plastic piping and other artificial materials all useful additions. A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves will aid in the simulation of a\u00a0blackwater\u00a0environment. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are recommended since they will grow under such conditions. A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective.","It naturally inhabits sluggish or still environments therefore filtration, or at least water flow, should not be very strong. Very large water changes are best avoided with 10-15% weekly adequate provided the\u00a0tank\u00a0is lightly-stocked."],"diet":["Chiefly a micropredator feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton.","It can be a little picky in the aquarium and initially may not accept dried or otherwise prepared foods, though in many cases will learn to take them over time. At any rate it should be offered daily meals of small live or frozen fare such as Artemia nauplii, Daphnia, grindal worm, micro worm, etc., in order to develop ideal colour and conditioning."],"behaviour":["Tankmates must be chosen with care since this species is slow-moving and will easily be intimidated or outcompeted for food by larger/more boisterous tankmates. Peaceful, pelagic cyprinids such as Danionella, Microdevario, Trigonostigma, or smaller Rasbora species make good choices as do some loaches such as Pangio or Kottelatlimia spp. It\u2019s not recommended to combine it with the congener S. selatanensis in order to minimise the risk of hybridisation.","Though not gregarious in the sense of schooling/shoaling fishes it does seem to require interaction with conspecifics and displays more interesting behaviour when maintained in numbers, meaning we recommend the purchase of no less than 6 individuals. Groups develop noticeable hierarchies and you\u2019ll often see dominant individuals chasing away their rivals at feeding time or when occupying their favourite spot.","In addition, there exist observations of an intriguing behaviour in which an individual will lie on its side and allow another member of the group to mouth its body and fins. No damage has ever been noticed during these displays and neither do they seem to form part of any spawning ritual. Some have suggested it may be a method of establishing dominance between the fish but at present this can only be considered speculation."],"reproduction":["Historically there has been some confusion surrounding this species\u2018 method of reproduction with some sources listing it erroneously as a bubblenester or paternal mouthbrooder when it is by all accounts a maternal mouthbrooder. This is intriguing since this species and S. selatanensis are the only anabantoids in which the female broods the eggs, with all other mouth-brooding relatives having evolved a paternal strategy.","It can be bred in a group or single pair in a set-up as suggested above, and provided the quality of both water and diet is maintained should not prove too difficult. Courtship is normally initiated by the male, or alpha male if multiple individuals are present, and nuptial behaviour can be recognised by an individual taking on a darker, almost greyish patterning, while receptive females intensify in colouration, becoming a deep chocolate brown with the light vertical bars appearing golden.","The climactic spawning embrace is similar to that seen in Luciocephalus and Parasphaerichthys species in that the pair remain almost upright, rather than the female being turned upside down as in Betta and most other anabantoid genera. The spawning process may take several hours with eggs laid and fertilised on the substrate and the female collecting them in her mouth directly. The surrounding area is defended by both fish throughout.","Brooding females tend to take refuge in a quiet area of the tank and eat very little, if at all. The eggs/fry are retained in the mouth for 7 \u2013 20 days before 10-40 fully-formed, free swimming juveniles are released. The female can be removed to a separate tank a few days post-spawning in order to minimise the chances of fry predation if you prefer though in mature, heavily-decorated set-ups some may survive. Alternatively the fry can be removed as they are released/spotted provided water of the same chemistry and temperature is available elsewhere.","The fry should be large enough to accept live foods such as microworm or Artemia nauplii immediately, and daily water changes of around 10% of tank volume should also be performed in order to maintain water quality and growth rate. The rearing tank must have a tightly-fitting cover (some breeders use clingfilm/shrinkwrap to ensure no gaps) as they need access to a layer of warm, humid air to ensure proper development of the labyrinth organ."],"create_time":1426713851.9456}
