The species is unfussy with regards to decor. Some cover can be provided in the form of roots, branches or large, smooth rocks, and any artificial lighting should be very dim. A sandy or muddy substrate is beneficial but not essential. What is most important is that the cover of the tank cannot be moved by the fish, and contains no gaps. It will escape given the slightest opportunity. A gap of around 6\u2033 should be left between the water surface and the cover to allow it access to the atmospheric air it needs to survive."],"diet":["","Omnivorous in nature, feeding on fish, shellfish, amphibians and plant matter. It will adapt to a variety of foods in an aquarium. Offer prawn, mussel, lancefish, algae wafers and other vegetable matter. Larger specimens can be fed whole fish such as trout or sprats."],"behaviour":["","Best kept singly and alone. Some hobbyists do keep these with other large species but it\u2019s very risky. Lungfish are unpredictable and can bite chunks out of other fish at will. Specimens that have been kept in a community situation for some time have been known to suddenly turn on their tankmates. It is also completely intolerant of congeners and should always be kept as a single specimen."],"reproduction":["","Not achieved in aquaria, but it is being produced commercially on a single farm in Australia. In nature the fish spawn just prior to the rainy season, and in contrast to other lungfish species, exhibit no parental care whatsoever. The young are initially capable of taking in air via their skin surfaces."],"create_time":1426712897.24768}
