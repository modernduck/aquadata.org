Dried food is rarely taken."],"behaviour":["","Less shy than M. ansorgei this is still quite a slow-moving fish and will easily be out-competed by more boisterous species at feeding time, so is best kept with small, peaceful species that inhabit the upper and lower parts of the tank such as hatchetfish, lampeyes, corydoras and small loricariids. Males are territorial so a larger tank should be provided if several are to be kept together."],"reproduction":["","Has been achieved in captivity. Bubblenester. A dimly-lit, well-planted aquarium with lots of floating plants and soft, acidic water is required to spawn these fish. Condition them with live food. The male will build a fairly complex bubblenest amongst floating vegetation or under a broad leaf. Spawning occurs under the nest in a typical anabantoid embrace. The eggs hatch in around 24 hours and become free-swimming in 2-3 days. It is best to remove the parents after hatching. The fry are tiny and should be fed infusoria for the first week, after which they will accept brine shrimp nauplii."],"create_time":1426712698.87802}
