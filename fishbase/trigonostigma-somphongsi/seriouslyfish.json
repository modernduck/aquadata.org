It\u2019s reckoned to occur somewhere in the Mae Klong basin and has been reported from Ratchaburi province through which a section of the river flows. Type locality is given simply as \u2018Thailand\u2019.","Alarmingly several native species including Balantiocheilos melanopterus and Yasuhikotakia sidthimunki have already disappeared from that collection area due to the construction of three large dams disrupting the annual flooding of the river and destroying their breeding cycles."],"habitat":["Needs to be confirmed but all other members of the genus inhabit gently flowing sections of forest streams and tributaries where submerged aquatic plants such as Cryptocoryne species grow thickly.","The water is sometimes stained faintly brown/yellow due to the presence of tannins and other chemicals released by decomposing organic matter and the substrate scattered with fallen leaves, twigs, and branches. Such environments characteristically contain soft, weakly acidic to neutral water and are often dimly-lit due to dense marginal vegetation and the forest canopy above."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not especially critical though it apparently shows better colouration in a heavily-planted set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate.\u00a0A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves will aid in simulating a\u00a0blackwater\u00a0environment. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are recommended since they will grow under such conditions. A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective."],"diet":"Probably a micropredator feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans, and other zooplankton in nature.\u00a0In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia, alongside good quality dried flakes and granules.","behaviour":"If it ever becomes available in large numbers it will almost certainly make an excellent community fish but for now the emphasis should be on captive reproduction and we therefore recommend maintaining it alone. It is a schooling species by nature so if the opportunity to purchase a group arises it should be taken.","reproduction":["Captive breeding of this species should be considered a priority for any hobbyist lucky enough to obtain it. By all accounts it is not too difficult, with the process occuring in an identical fashion to others in the genus, but the overall yield of eggs tends to be very small (A. Vassiere, pers. comm.).","Like many small cyprinids it exhibits no parental care although it does utilise a different spawning method to most as the eggs are attached to broad plant leaves. When the fish are in good condition they will spawn often and in a densely-planted, mature aquarium it is possible that small numbers of young may start to appear without human intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of fry a slightly more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but a separate tank should also be set up. This should be very dimly lit with the base either left bare or covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plant can pass through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them. The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type matting can also be used and works very well.","The water itself should ideally be of pH 5.0-6.0, 1-5\u00b0H with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. A decent-sized clump of Microsorium, Cryptocoryne, other broad-leaved plant or artificial alternative should also be included. Filtration is not really necessary but you can use a small, air-powered sponge filter if you prefer.","UK expert breeder Alan Vassiere has had success using a similar method with bare tank base, a small sponge filter and a single artificial plant. His stock tank is maintained at around 7\u00b0GH and a pH of 7.2, but for spawning the fish he uses reverse osmosis water adjusted to a pH of around 6.0 and small amounts of reverse osmosis containing alder cone extracts (made by simply boiling the water, pouring over a few alder cones and left overnight to infuse) are also added.","Some breeders of other Trigonostigma spp. report that older fish aged a year or more make the best subjects for spawning which may be the reason why this species is often said to be difficult to breed. Apparently it is trickier to initiate spawning behaviour in younger individuals and they are also are less fecund.","At any rate the best way to condition them is by feeding small amounts of live and frozen foods 2 or 3 times a day in the weeks leading up to a spawning attempt. When the females appear full of eggs and the males are showing their best colours as they display to one another a large (40-50% of tank volume), cool water change should be performed and one or two pairs introduced to each spawning container a few hours later, preferably in the evening.","Spawning usually occurs in the morning hours and is preceded by a flurry of courtship activity by the male(s). Often a pair will perform a number of \u2018dry runs\u2019 over a chosen spawning surface and it may be several hours before any eggs are produced.","Eventually the female will begin to lay small batches of eggs which are fertilised by the male before the next batch is laid. The spawning process is particularly interesting as often a female will choose the underside of a plant leaf and thus the pair will be observed in an inverted position as eggs and sperm are released.","If the pair(s) fail to spawn immediately they can be left in situ but if no eggs have been observed after 3 or 4 days they should be returned to the main group and a different set of fish chosen. There is no need to feed the adults while they are in the spawning tank.","Post-spawning the adults will eat any eggs they find so either they or the eggs themselves should be removed as soon as possible. Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but usually takes between 24 and 48 hours with the young free-swimming in around a week. Initial food should be Paramecium or similar introducing Artemia nauplii and/or microworm once the fry are large enough to accept them.","Thanks to Alan P. Vaissiere."],"create_time":1426714145.64191}
