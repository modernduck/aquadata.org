It was considered (but not formally assessed for the IUCN Red List) as Extinct in the Wild for several years as a result of habitat loss and degradation, and fishing, but individuals appear occasionally in shipments of other small fishes for the aquarium trade in Germany and Japan.<br/><br/>It appears that the species is still present in the wild within its previous range, but the location of the specimens found in the aquarium trade is not currently known.
