locality is \u2018Amazon River near mouth of Rio Negro and Tabatinga, Brazil\u2019, but this species is widespread throughout\u00a0rivers of Guyana plus the western Amazon basin in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia.","Records exist from most major Amazon tributaries in this region including the Negro, Branco, Madeira,\u00a0Guapor\u00e9/It\u00e9nez, Juru\u00e1, Japur\u00e1, Putomayo, Javari, Napo, Nanay, Ucayali, and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n.","Though wild fish are still exported on a regular basis, many of those seen on sale in the aquarium trade are farmed commercially.","Wild populations vary in colour pattern depending on origin, and some populations have previously been described as distinct species.","A form from Peru has a particularly silvery body colour, for example, while another, marketed as \u2018super red\u2019 possesses an unusually long red stripe on the body, extending much of the length of the dark central stripe.","A population from around Boa Vista in the rio Branco system, Par\u00e1 state, Brazil has an ocellus on the caudal-fin."],"habitat":["Inhabits sluggish tributaries, small rivers and swampy areas, particularly in areas with dense growth of aquatic vegetation or submerged woody structures and leaf litter.","It\u2019s often found in areas of flooded forest and floodplain lakes in blackwater regions.","Typical habitats contain shallow, near still water with very little detectable hardness, low conductivity, and a pH of 4.0-6.0, with other fishes comprising small characids, other lebiasinids, and dwarf cichlids of the genus\u00a0Apistogramma.","La Arenosa is a small stream in Amazonas department, southern Colombia which flows down from terra firme forest into a floodplain of the Amazon mainstream.","It varies from 2-5 m in width and up to 2 m in depth and contains slowly-moving, clear blackwater the majority of the time, temporarily increasing in depth and flow rate after storms.","PH ranges from 5.51-6.01, conductivity 18-38 \u00b5S/cm, dissolved oxygen 70%, and an average water temperature of 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F.","N. trifasciatus\u00a0was found to be a permanent resident of the stream in a study conducted over a period of one year, with sympatric species including the congener\u00a0N. marginatus\u00a0plus\u00a0Axelrodia stigmatias,\u00a0Hemigrammus analis,\u00a0H. bellottii,\u00a0H. ocellifer,\u00a0H. schmardae,\u00a0H. copelandi,\u00a0Moenkhausia comma,\u00a0M. sanctafilomenae,\u00a0Tyttocharax cochui,\u00a0Tetragonopterus argenteus,\u00a0Characidium zebra,\u00a0Crenuchus spilurus,\u00a0Hoplias malabaricus,\u00a0Carnegiella strigata,\u00a0Copella nattereri,\u00a0Corydoras semiaquilis,\u00a0Megalechis thoracata,\u00a0Limatulichthys griseus,\u00a0Farlowella amazona,\u00a0Eigenmannia virescens,\u00a0Aequidens diadema,\u00a0Apistogramma bitaeniata,\u00a0Satanoperca\u00a0sp., \u00a0Cichla monoculus,\u00a0Crenicichla saxatilis, and\u00a0Monocirrhus polyacanthus."],"maintenance":["Should ideally be kept in a heavily-planted\u00a0set-up, preferably with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The broken lines of sight that exist in such a display allow it to display natural behaviour as well as helping to reduce skittishness.","Floating plants are a useful addition as are driftwood branches and dried leaf litter, the latter in particular driving\u00a0establishment of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","Such microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","Filtration need only be gentle with an air-powered sponge-style unit normally adequate, although a degree of water movement is acceptable."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful and will not compete well with very boisterous or much larger tankmates.","In a community it\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes but sedate surface-dwellers such as hatchetfishes are best omitted, especially in smaller aquaria.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not often predate\u00a0fry.","In a more general\u00a0community\u00a0set-up it can be combined with smaller rasboras, barbs, anabantoids, etc.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with territorial rival males sparring on a regular basis during daylight hours.","It\u2019s more aggressive than the majority of congeners, and in confined quarters serious injury or even death can occur.","For this reason a spacious aquarium should be used and d\u00e9cor arranged in such a way that plenty of broken lines-of-sight are provided.","Buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above.","An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single\u00a0pair\u00a0or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container, though it\u2019s worth noting that the more individuals involved the greater the risk of\u00a0egg\u00a0predation, plus males may distract each other from females if there\u2019s more than one in the\u00a0tank.","The adults can be removed after 2-3 days and the first fry should be visible around 3 days later.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them.","In memory of master fish-breeder Alan P. Vaissiere who assisted extensively with this section."],"create_time":1426712858.59729}
