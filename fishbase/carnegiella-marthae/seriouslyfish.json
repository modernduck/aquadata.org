(2011) suggesting the existence of at least three species in the Rio Negro basin alone (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"habitat":["Appears to be a\u00a0stenotypic\u00a0inhabitant of blackwater environments.","In the rio Negro system it inhabits so-called\u00a0igap\u00f3\u00a0and\u00a0igarap\u00e9\u00a0habitats\u00a0characterised by thick, often overhanging, riparian vegetation and substrates covered in fallen branches, tree roots and leaf litter.","The water is typically acidic, of negligible carbonate hardness and conductivity and\u00a0stained brownish due to the presence of humic substances released by decomposing organic matter.","The Negro has a substantial floodplain and the water level can rise by up to 15 metres during the annual wet season.","During the period of inundation small fishes such as\u00a0C. marthae\u00a0move upstream within the river\u2019s tributaries and then laterally into the flooded forest itself to feed and reproduce, before returning to the tributaries when the water falls."],"maintenance":["Should ideally be maintained\u00a0in a heavily-planted\u00a0set-up, preferably with a dark\u00a0substrate\u00a0and some patches of floating vegetation around which the fish will tend to congregate since they spend almost all of their time at or towards the surface.","Driftwood branches and dried leaf litter can also be added, the latter in particular driving\u00a0establishment of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","Such microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","Water movement should be gentle to moderate and be sure that the aquarium cover is tightly-fitting as this species may jump when startled (but see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"diet":["Primarily a\u00a0predator\u00a0feeding on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0taken at or near the water surface in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc.","Small insects such as young crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use although, it is best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","In a community it is best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids, and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","It is very much a\u00a0gregarious\u00a0animal so buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded.","create_time":1426710828.80095}
