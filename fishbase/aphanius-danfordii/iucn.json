Sultan Sazl\u0131\u011f\u0131 marshes once formed a very important wetland area which has been drained and finally dried out in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century. This species is now restricted to two small spring fields (each 2\u20133 km\u00b2) about 15 km apart, and a few canals attached to the springs in the area (area of occupancy is less than 10 km\u00b2, and extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than 40 km\u00b2). All the water bodies in the area are fed from one aquifer (therefore one location is estimated as water abstraction is the major threat). The species has strongly declined in the past due to the draining of Sultan Sazl\u0131\u011f\u0131 marshes (for agriculture) and is expected to continuously decline in the future as this process is continuing. The species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.</p>","assessor":"Freyhof, J.","evaluator":"Ekmek\u00e7i, F. & Smith, K."}]
