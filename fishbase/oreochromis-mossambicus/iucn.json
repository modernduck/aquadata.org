Hybridization is already occurring throughout the northern part of the species' range, with most of the evidence coming from the Limpopo River system. In terms of locations the threat of <em>Oreochromis niloticus</em> is widespread, but probably more than 50% of the locations are not yet affected. Given the rapid spread of <em>O. niloticus</em> it is anticipated that this species will qualify as threatened under Criterion A due to rapid population decline through hybridization. The species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","assessor":"Cambray, J. & Swartz, E.","evaluator":"Tweddle, D. (Freshwater Fish Red List Authority) & Darwall, W.
