Penang Island, Tiak/Perak, Batang Berjuntai/Selangor, Sepang/Selangor, etc.","Introduction of ornamental forms and other Betta spp.\u00a0is known to be having an adverse effect on the purity of some wild populations, the species having been heavily line-bred for aggression in southern Thailand, where it\u2019s used in organised bouts in the same way as B. splendens elsewhere, and for the aquarium hobby, with many different strains available. It\u2019s also been introduced elsewhere, with feral populations now established in Singapore, for example."],"habitat":["Inhabits still and sluggish waters, including rice paddies, swamps, roadside ditches, streams and ponds. These are often shaded by submerged, surface or marginal vegetation and sometimes contain little dissolved oxygen. Water conditions tend to vary and change rapidly during the annual monsoon season. Substrates can vary from leaf litter to mud, sand, or deep sediment.","While most populations inhabit freshwaters some are found in brackish coastal swamps."],"maintenance":["This species does best in a well-planted, shady tank with plenty of surface cover in the form of tall stem plants, floating types\u00a0such as Salvinia or Riccia spp. or\u00a0tropical lilies from the genus\u00a0Nymphaea. Cryptocoryne spp.\u00a0are also a good choice and will cope with the dim conditions.","Driftwood can also be used and other plants such as\u00a0Microsorum or\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. can be attached to it. Small clay plant pots, lengths of plastic piping or empty camera film cases can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of some dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) is also recommended. In addition to offering additional shelter for the fish it brings with it the establishment of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs. These microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","As it\u00a0naturally inhabits sluggish waters filtration should not be too strong, with an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0set to turn over gently adequate. Keep the\u00a0tank\u00a0well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an\u00a0excellent jumper."],"diet":"Likely to prey on insects and other small invertebrates/zooplankton\u00a0in nature.\u00a0Captive fish\u00a0will normally accept dried products once they\u2019re recognised as edible, but should be offered plenty of small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0regularly to ensure development of optimal colour and condition. Take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. seem particularly prone to obesity.","behaviour":["Not recommended for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon. It\u2019s requirements and disposition mean it\u2019s best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate and outcompete it.","Some small cyprinids and loaches that inhabit similar environments in nature are compatible, but the presence of any other fishes can be a distracting influence should a pair decide to spawn.","Provided with sufficient cover and broken lines-of-sight it\u2019s possible to keep more than one male per tank, though it\u2019s best to isolate pairs for breeding purposes in most cases."],"reproduction":["Bubblenester.\u00a0Organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","The\u00a0pair\u00a0need not be separated prior to\u00a0spawning. The male may construct the nest in a tube or canister, under a broad plant leaf or among fine-leaved surface vegetation, and will not usually tolerate the female in the vicinity until it\u2019s complete.","Just prior to spawning the body colour of the female pales and dark bars appear on the flanks, with the act itself normally occurring\u00a0below the nest in an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids, with the male wrapping himself around the female. At the point of climax milt and a few eggs are released which the female proceeds to catch between pelvic fins and body.","The male then transfers them to his nest while the female recovers any that fell. This cycle is then repeated until the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0that can take some time.","Post-spawning\u00a0the adults can normally be left\u00a0in situ\u00a0although the female is no longer actively involved with the male assuming sole responsibility for guarding and tending the nest.","The eggs hatch in 24-48 hours, remaining in the nest for a further 3-4 days until the yolk sac is fully-absorbed, while the male continues to collecting and return any that fall. If threatened the entire nest may be moved elsewhere. Once the fry begin to swim freely the male will lose interest, but the adults do not usually eat their offspring.","The fry will require an infusoria-type food for the first few days, after which they should be large enough to accept\u00a0\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones.","This species has been hybridised\u00a0with domesticated B. splendens, B. smaragdina and the undescribed B. sp. \u2018Mahachai\u2019 and\u00a0selectively line-bred for the aquarium trade, leading to the development of a number of colour forms that do not occur naturally."],"create_time":1426710598.64182}
