Adults inhabit riffles and runs and are likely to display a preference for shallower zones.","Substrates are generally composed of\u00a0gravel, rocks, boulders or bedrock carpeted with a rich\u00a0biofilm\u00a0formed by\u00a0algae\u00a0and other micro-organisms.","Juveniles are often found in slower-moving stretches with gravel substrate and submerged tree roots. In both cases patches of aquatic plants are only occasionally present but riparian\u00a0vegetation is usually well-developed.","In the Kahang\u00a0River, part of the Endau drainage in Johor state, Peninsular Malaysia it\u2019s been recorded alongside\u00a0Homalopteroides tweediei, H. nebulosus,\u00a0Homaloptera parclitella,\u00a0H. ogilviei,\u00a0Malayochela maassi,\u00a0Crossocheilus langei,\u00a0Cyclocheilichthys apogon,\u00a0Mystacoleucus marginatus,\u00a0Rasbora dusonensis,\u00a0R. elegans,\u00a0R. paucisqualis,\u00a0Trigonopoma gracile, \u2018Puntius\u2018 partipentazona,\u00a0Nemacheilus masyae,\u00a0N. selangoricus,\u00a0Neohomaloptera johorensis,\u00a0Acanthopsoides molobrion,\u00a0Pangio cuneovirgata,\u00a0P. doriae,\u00a0P. kuhlii,\u00a0P. malayana,\u00a0P. piperata,\u00a0P. shelfordii,\u00a0Pseudomystus fuscus,\u00a0Akysis microps,\u00a0A. hendricksoni, and an unidentified\u00a0species\u00a0of\u00a0Glyptothorax."],"maintenance":["Most importantly the water must be clean and well-oxygenated so we suggest the use of an over-sized\u00a0filter\u00a0as a minimum requirement. Turnover should ideally be 10-15 times per hour so additional powerheads, airstones, etc., should be employed as necessary to achieve the desired flow and\u00a0oxygenation.","Base\u00a0substrate\u00a0can either be of\u00a0gravel,\u00a0sand\u00a0or a mixture of both to which should be added a layer of water-worn rocks and pebbles of varying sizes.","Driftwood roots and branches are also suitable and aquatic\u00a0plants from adaptable genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Crinum\u00a0and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can also be included. The latter are particularly useful as\u00a0Homaloptera\u00a0spp. appear to enjoy resting on their leaves.","Since it needs stable water conditions and feeds on\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass.","While regular partial water changes are essential\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0can be allowed to grow on all surfaces except perhaps the viewing pane."],"diet":["Homaloptera\u00a0spp. are specialised grazers feeding on\u00a0biofilm, small crustaceans, insect\u00a0larvae\u00a0and other invertebrates.","In captivity some sinking dried foods may be accepted but regular meals of live or frozen\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, etc., are essential for the maintenance of good health and it\u2019s highly preferable if the\u00a0tank\u00a0contains rock and other solid surfaces with growths of\u00a0algae\u00a0and other\u00a0aufwuchs.","Balitorids are often seen on sale in an emaciated state which can be difficult to correct. A good dealer will have done something about this prior to sale but if you decide to take a chance with severely weakened specimens they\u2019ll initially require a continual, easily-obtainable source of suitable foods in the absence of competitors if they\u2019re to recover."],"behaviour":["Not an aggressive fish although its particular requirements limit the choice of suitable tankmates.","Species\u00a0inhabiting similar environments include\u00a0Barilius,\u00a0Discherodontus,\u00a0Garra, Devario, some\u00a0Rasbora, gobies from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Rhinogobius,\u00a0Sicyopterus\u00a0and\u00a0Stiphodon\u00a0plus\u00a0Glyptothorax,\u00a0Akysis\u00a0and\u00a0Oreoglanis\u00a0spp. catfishes.","Many loaches from the\u00a0family\u00a0Nemacheilidae and most from Balitoridae are also suitable although harmless squabbles may occur with the latter group in particular. Research your choices before purchase to be sure.","It\u2019s found living in aggregations in nature so buy six or more to see it at its best as when kept singly, in pairs or trios it\u2019s less bold, although it should be noted that this is among the more retiring members of the genus."],"reproduction":"Presumably a seasonal spawner in nature but nothing has been recorded in aquaria.","create_time":1426712057.44424}
