Anecdotal information  from fishermen suggest that catches have gone from a catch of 2-3 fish  per day to one fish every 2-3 days, a significant decline (N. Chansue  pers. comm.). In Cambodia, fishers (  reported a 62% decline in the catch of this species since 1980 (Z. Hogan,  unpublished data). The average size of an individual fish has also fallen from 23.2kg in 1980 to 6.9kg in 2006. At the same time, the maximum size  of a fish reported in an average season dropped from 175kg in the  1980\u2019s to 60kg in recent times.
