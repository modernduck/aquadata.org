Threats in Thailand are from poor habitat management, including the destruction of the forest canopy which leads to drought upstream and flooding downstream during the monsoon, as well as dam building which prevents migratory fish breeding successfully, and therefore reduces available prey. In Australia the main threat to this species is thought to be silt from uranium mines which contains heavy metals and radio-isotopes. However, it is not known how threatening this is to these fish (4). Throughout its range, the giant freshwater stingray is at risk from both direct and incidental fishing, habitat destruction and range fragmentation leading to inbreeding depression (2).","agents":[{"full_name":"ARKive","homepage":"http://www.arkive.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"81d6f78ea6ad20e8065c8d74446a2e42","dataObjectVersionID":6695125,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Management","mimeType":"text/html","title":"Conservation","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","rights":"Copyright Wildscreen 2003-2008","rightsHolder":"Wildscreen","audience":"General public","source":"http://www.arkive.org/giant-freshwater-stingray/himantura-chaophraya/","description":"Further research into this incredible fish's biology and status is necessary.
