It has been collected from several\u00a0major tributaries including\u00a0the r\u00edos Atabapo, Guaviare, Inirida, Ventauri, Meta, Cinaruco, Arauca, Apure, Capanaparo, and Caura.","Type locality was originally given as \u2018Leticia, Peru\u2019, but later corrected to \u2018R\u00edo\u00a0Muco, upper R\u00edo Orinoco basin, Colombia\u2019 by G\u00e9ry (1966)."],"habitat":["Apparently\u00a0favours minor tributaries, smaller rivers, oxbows, and flooded forests rather than main river channels.","It occurs throughout the vast llanos regions of Colombia and Venezuela, and in the latter country is often associated with habitats known as\u00a0morichals\u00a0which tend to contain transparent, clear water and sandy substrates, often with dense growth of aquatic plants or riparian vegetation among which the fish take shelter.","In other parts of its range it has been collected from both flowing blackwater habitats and still floodplain lakes, while the majority of rivers and wetlands across its range are subject to extreme flooding\u00a0during the annual rainy season.","One example of a natural habitat is the R\u00edo Cinaruco, a low nutrient, blackwater tributary of the Orinoco in southwestern Venezuela which comprises a meandering river channel with numerous interconnected lagoons and floodplain lakes.","The latter two biotope-types feature reduced water flow, increased turbidity and temperature, a greater accumulation of leaf litter, and higher densities of zooplankton than the main channel.","Other fishes occurring in the R\u00edo Orinoco basin and available in the trade include Corydoras delphax,\u00a0Platydoras costatus, Baryancistrus beggini, Hypancistrus inspector, Panqolus maccus, Panaque nigrolineatus, Hemigrammus rhodostomus, H. stictus, Paracheirodon axelrodi, Pristella maxillaris, Copella nattereri, Biotodoma wavrini,\u00a0Heros severus, Mesonauta insignis, Satanoperca daemon and Uaru fernandezyepezi."],"maintenance":["Perhaps looks best\u00a0in an arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches, or heavily-planted planted set-up.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","The latter are useful since they provide an additional food source for both adults and fry while the humic substances released by decaying leaves are also considered beneficial."],"diet":["Likely to be omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It is perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens\u00a0since this species forms temporary dominance hierarchies within which males compete for female attention, and therefore displays more interesting behaviour and better colouration when maintained in numbers."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention, but if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water. This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them. The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles. Alternatively, filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container and left in place until eggs are detected (typically the following morning).","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712220.04114}
