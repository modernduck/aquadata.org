It doesn\u2019t appreciate bright conditions and we suggest the use of floating plants to diffuse the light entering the tank. Allow open spaces between areas of planting to allow swimming space."],"diet":["","It prefers live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, earthworms, prawns etc., but most will also take small pellets or flakes. Unlike most Auchenipterids it will usually feed during daylight hours."],"behaviour":["","Safe with all but the smallest of fry, and so suitable for most community aquaria. Ideally, keep it in a South American biotope aquarium, with tetras, dwarf cichlids and other peaceful catfish such as Corydoras sp. and smaller Loricariids. It\u2019s totally unaggressive towards conspecifics, and is happier when kept in a group."],"reproduction":["","Has been achieved but very little data is available. In common with other members of the family, fertilisation is internal."],"create_time":1426714102.08962}
