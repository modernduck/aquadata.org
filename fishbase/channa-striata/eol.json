Found mainly in swamps, but also occurs in the lowland rivers.  More common in relatively deep (1-2 m), still water.  Very common in freshwater plains (Ref. 4515, 57235).  Occur in medium to large rivers, brooks, flooded fields and stagnant waters including sluggish flowing canals (Ref. 12975).  Survive dry season by burrowing in bottom mud of lakes, canals and swamps as long as skin and air-breathing apparatus remain moist (Ref. 2686) and subsists on the stored fat (Ref. 1479).  Feed on fish,  frogs, snakes, insects, earthworms, tadpoles (Ref. 1479) and crustaceans (Ref. 2847).  Undertake lateral migration from the Mekong mainstream, or other permanent water bodies, to flooded areas during the flood season and return to the permanent water bodies at the onset of the dry season (Ref. 37770).  During winter and dry season, its flesh around coelomic cavity is heavily infested by a larval trematode Isoparorchis hypselobargi.  Other parasites infecting this fish include Pallisentis ophicephali in the intestine and Neocamallanus ophicepahli in the pyloric caecae (Ref. 1479).  Processed into pra-hoc, mam-ruot, and mam-ca-loc (varieties of fish paste) in Kampuchea (Ref.4929).  Perhaps the main food fish in Thailand, Indochina and Malaysia (Ref. 2686).  Firm white flesh almost bone-free, heavy dark skin good for soup and usually sold separately (Ref. 2686).  In Hawaiian waters the largest specimen taken reportedly exceeded 150 cm (Ref. 44091).  Very economic important on both cultures and captures throughout southern and southeastern Asia (Ref. 57235).","agents":[{"full_name":"Susan M.
