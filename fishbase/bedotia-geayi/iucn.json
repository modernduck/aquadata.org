Its presence in rivers to the north remains a possibility but needs confirmation. In the adjacent Namorona drainage the species is replaced by <em>Bedotia</em> sp. Ranomafana. Habitat degradation and pressure from exotic predators (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>) and competitors (<em>Xiphophorus</em> spp.) have eliminated <em>B. geayi</em> from low altitude (&lt; 100 m a.s.l) habitats, however, it remains abundant in the middle and upper reaches of the Mananjary. Pending major shifts in land use in the basin, this species is assessed as Vulnerable on the basis of its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy being less than 20,000 km\u00b2 and 2,000 km\u00b2, respectively, with a continuing decline in distribution due to the above mentioned pressures.","assessor":"Loiselle, P. & participants of the CBSG/ANGAP CAMP \"Faune de Madagascar\" workshop, Mantasoa, Madagascar 2001","evaluator":"Stiassny, M.L.J., Sparks, J.S.
