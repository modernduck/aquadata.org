Floating vegetation is also recommended in order to diffuse the light entering the tank. Other planting is beneficial but not essential."],"diet":["","S. acanthomias is a particularly voracious feeder but is generally unfussy. Frozen, live and dried foods are all accepted. It also relishes vegetable matter in the form of shelled peas, cucumber etc., which it will rasp at with the teeth in its lower jaw."],"behaviour":["","This is a very robust species and should be kept only with tankmates that can stand their own ground such as large Central American and African cichlids, large characins and barbs and Loricariids. It is particularly pugnacious to conspecifics and other members of the same genus. We recommend it is the last fish to be introduced to a community in order to minimise the risk of aggression."],"reproduction":["","Not recorded in aquaria."],"create_time":1426713922.68166}
