Records from the Chao Phraya basin in Thailand are thought to have been introduced specimens from the Mekong population. The parts of the Mekong where this species is found are under heavy bycatch fishing pressure, and it is being affected by habitat degradation which is directly affecting this species. A population decline of at least 50% has been observed over the last twenty years, and the decline is expected to continue. The species is considered&#160; to be \"highly vulnerable\" to impacts from mainstream dam development on the Mekong mainstream and associated tributaries, and if they were to be  developed, the dams would have further severe impacts on the species reproductive  success and recruitment. The species is assessed as Endangered due to recent population decline resulting from fishery bycatch, pollution from a range of sources, and the decline of suitable habitat.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Kottelat, M., Gibson, C. & Juffe Bignoli, D."}]
