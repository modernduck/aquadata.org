Conversely during dry periods some habitats may become stagnant with blooms of macrophytic algae and resultant hypoxia (oxygen depletion).","Under such conditions members of this genus are able to use the intestine as a supplementary breathing organ and have been observed darting to the surface to gulp atmospheric air. Some species have even been recorded to survive periods in moist sand or mud in the absence of water."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep but must be provided with a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0since some of its time will be spent completely buried, or with only eyes protruding.\u00a0When coarser\u00a0gravel\u00a0is used it may become stressed or damage itself trying to dig, and feeding behaviour can be inhibited.","Other d\u00e9cor can include water-worn rocks and driftwood branches and tree roots arranged to form plenty of hiding places and shaded spots \u2013 add these prior to the\u00a0substrate\u00a0to prevent them being toppled by digging activity.","Lighting can be quite dim unless you intend to grow plants and a few handfuls of leaf litter would complement the natural effect.","As this\u00a0species\u00a0hails from sluggish waters high flow rates are best avoided although a degree of\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0is recommended.","Ensure that small specimens are unable to enter\u00a0filter\u00a0intakes and cover the\u00a0tank\u00a0well as most loaches do jump at times, especially when first introduced."],"diet":["Chiefly a micropredator typically sifting mouthfuls of substrate through the gills from which insect larvae, small crustaceans and suchlike are extracted.","In the aquarium it will accept sinking dried foods but should also be offered regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia, Artemia, bloodworm, etc."],"behaviour":["Lepidocephalichthys\u00a0spp. are peaceful both with one another and other fishes and there exist no reports of them harming tankmates though they may prey on eggs or\u00a0fry.","They fare best in the presence of conspecifics and should ideally be kept in a group of 4 or more specimens.","L. tomaculum\u00a0should do well alongside fishes from similar environments that occupy the upper part of the\u00a0water column\u00a0such as\u00a0Trichopodus,\u00a0Trichogaster,\u00a0Trichopsis\u00a0or certain\u00a0Danio\u00a0species.","The presence of these should also make it less timid as the absence of fishes in the upper water column is often used as a signifier for approaching danger in nature.","Sand-dwelling loaches from the families Botiidae, Cobitidae and Nemacheilidae are also suitable but proper research is essential as some can be excessively\u00a0territorial\u00a0or otherwise aggressive.","A community based around fishes from its natural waters could include species such as Badis badis, Acanthocobitis zonalternans, Lepidocephalichthys guntea, Danio rerio, Trichogaster chuna and Trichogaster lalius."],"reproduction":"Presumably a seasonal spawner in nature but hasn\u2019t been bred in captivity as far as we know.","create_time":1426712436.2236}
