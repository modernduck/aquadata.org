However, degradation due to deforestation leading to sedimentation is common across much of the range, and the impact of dams, of which there are many current or planned in hill areas within India, is uncertain, and the species may qualify for a threatened category if its range proves to be restricted to the Brahmaputra basin, and it should be re-assessed if this taxonomic revision is undertaken.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N.","evaluator":"Budha, P.B., Mitra, T.R., Barbhuiya, A.H., Nguyen, T.H.T., Jha, B.R., Kakkasery, F., Rema Devi, K.R., Dahanukar, N., Vishwanath, W., Ng, H.H., Allen, D.J. & Daniel, B.A."}]
