It tends to be associated with soft substrates of mud and sand, where it lives among submerged roots, branches and vegetation."],"maintenance":["","Rocks and bogwood to form territories. Lives in lakes and slower moving water in the wild, so avoid strong current in the aquarium. Plants are best avoided as the will be uprooted. Trimacs will rearrange the tank as they see fit!"],"diet":["","A predatory species that feeds on other fish and both aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."],"behaviour":["","A fairly aggressive cichild, the trimac will not tolerate other tankmates easily. It may be possible to keep this fish as part of a large robust cichild community if enough tank space is provided."],"reproduction":["","Breeding is fairly easy. The pair usually select a flat stone and spawn on that. Up to 1000 eggs may be laid. Trimacs make excellent parents and will guard the eggs fiercely. Both parents will also tend the fry when hatched."],"create_time":1426711010.09074}
