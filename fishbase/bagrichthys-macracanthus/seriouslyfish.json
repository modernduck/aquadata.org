Provide plenty of hiding places in the form of clay flowerpots, lengths of plastic piping, driftwood tangles etc.. Plants are not essential but useful in reducing the amount of light hitting the bottom of the tank as well as offering cover.","If you\u2019re keeping multiple specimens or other similarly-sized catfishes try to arrange the d\u00e9cor in such a way as to form distinct territories.","The heater\u00a0should also be placed in such a way that it doesn\u2019t allow the fish to rest behind or against it. Also note that this species doesn\u2019t appreciate strong water flow."],"diet":["Apparently feeds on small, benthic animals and organic detritus in nature but will accept most aquarium foods.","Small live and frozen fare such as Artemia, Tubifex, bloodworm, etc., are particularly suitable, and high-quality, sinking dried products enriched with Spirulina or other vegetable content should also be offered regularly."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with species inhabiting other areas of the tank\u00a0and has a relatively small mouth so is unable to swallow anything larger than a few millimetres in length.","It may be seen more often if maintained alongside schools of \u2018dither\u2019 fishes, for which good choices include larger rasboras, medium-sized barbs or perhaps the glass catfish\u00a0Kryptopterus\u00a0minor.","It is territorial towards other benthic species, especially conspecifics, and males in particular will not often tolerate each other in all but the largest aquaria. Keep a single male alongside 3 or more females for the best chance of long-term success as this should help reduce the chance of any single individual being targeted by the dominant male."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded in captivity as far as we know. In nature adults move into temporarily-flooded areas at the onset of the wet season to spawn.","create_time":1426710442.19707}
