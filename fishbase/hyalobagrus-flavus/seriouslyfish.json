It\u2019s biotope is typified by acidic blackwaters and it can often be found in large shoals, hovering under cover of floating vegetation, or amongst submerged grasses."],"maintenance":["","It does best in soft, acidic water conditions. The fish are more outgoing if they are provided with some cover, so try planting the tank quite densely in some areas, whilst leaving some open spaces for swimming. The addition of some floating vegetation to diffuse the light is also a good idea. Other decor can include driftwood and smooth rocks. Water movement should be kept to a minimum. It is sensitive to deteriorating water quality, so efficient filtration and a regular maintenance routine are essential."],"diet":["","The basis of the diet should be small frozen and live foods such as bloodworm, brineshrimp, daphnia etc. Dried foods are usually accepted but the fish will not develop their best condition if fed on these exclusively."],"behaviour":["","A very peaceful and gregarious little catfish which does best when kept in a shoal of at least six individuals. Tankmates are completely ignored and it is therefore suitable for most communities of small to medium-sized, peaceful species. Recommended tankmates include rasboras, danios and small loaches."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in captivity, although this is likely down to a lack of effort, rather than the degree of difficulty. Soft, acidic, tannin-stained water is probably a good start."],"create_time":1426712083.80829}
