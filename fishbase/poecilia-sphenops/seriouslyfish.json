Not recommended for the general community due to this. Good tankmates include other poecilia, some rainbowfish and hard water tolerant barbs and tetras."],"reproduction":["","Very easy if the correct water conditions are provided. Reproduces in standard livebearer fashion. As with other species the males can be somewhat incessant in their pursuit of females so we recommend that several females should be kept to every male in order to dissipate this. Areas of dense planting will also help. Gestation takes around 8 weeks and large broods of up to 120 fry are not uncommon. The adult fish will predate on the young so the best method of raising them is to remove the gravid female to a separate tank and allow her to give birth there before returning her to the main aquarium. The use of breeding nets or traps is not recommended as their small size is not suitable for raising fry. The fry are quite large and will accept brine shrimp nauplii or powdered flake from birth."],"create_time":1426713330.51961}
