A few individuals have recently been collected from the Buzi and Rovuma systems. Other populations are known from northern Lake Malawi affluents. These isolated eastern populations need to be critically examined using modern techniques. They are likely to be different from upper Zambezi populations.","rationale":"This species has a wide distribution, with no known major widespread threats. It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for eastern and southern Africa, however taxonomic changes may affect the listings for isolated eastern populations. It is estimated that less than 5 % of the species is found in the central Africa region, and it is therefore categorized as Not Applicable.","assessor":"Bills, R., Marshall, B., Moelants, T., Tweddle, D. & Vreven, E.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
