type locality is given simply as \u2018Suriname\u2019 but this species is widely distributed throughout northern drainages of the Amazon in Peru and Brazil plus the R\u00edo Orinoco in Venezuela and various coastal\u00a0river basins in Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.","habitat":["Inhabits major river channels and tributaries and said to show a preference for clear and black water environments as opposed to turbid \u2018white\u2019 waters.","It occurs sympatrically with literally hundreds of other species across its range but as an example some of those inhabiting the rio Purus, a tributary of the Amazon, include Leporinus friderici, Aphyocharax alburnus, Hemigrammus ocellifer, Hyphessobrycon bentosi, Leptagoniates pi, Moenkhausia oligolepis, Prionobrama filigera, Tetragonopterus argenteus, Triportheus angulatus, Thoracocharax stellatus, Corydoras armatus, C. trilineatus, Hemiodontichthys acipenserinus, Lamontichthys filamentosus, Otocinclus vittatus, Rineloricaria lanceolata, Bujurquina sp. cf. syspilus, Geophagus altifrons and Colomesus asellus."],"maintenance":["This\u00a0species\u00a0is a near-exclusive inhabitant of open water and an excess of cover can actually stress it meaning,\u00a0substrate\u00a0aside, the majority of the\u00a0tank\u00a0should be d\u00e9cor-free with plenty of open space.","Should you wish to create a natural effect use a sandy\u00a0substrate, perhaps with a few handfuls of leaf litter and some driftwood branches or roots.","Plants which can grow in\u00a0sand\u00a0can also be added as can those which prefer to be attached to solid surfaces such as\u00a0Microsorum pteropus,\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. while lighting can simply be tailored to the plants being used.","If using a deeper\u00a0tank\u00a0you could even fill it to 50-70% of capacity and add emergent branches or plants which can look very effective.","A tightly-fitting cover should be used in all cases since acestrorhynchids tend to be powerful\u00a0jumpers.","Efficient filtration is a must when keeping\u00a0predatory\u00a0species\u00a0due to the amount of waste produced so install one or more external canister filters and/or a\u00a0sump\u00a0system, organising the return in such a way that some surface movement is created.","Weekly water changes of 30-50% should be considered mandatory as this\u00a0species\u00a0can be sensitive to\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and swings in water chemistry, and for this reason it must never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups."],"diet":["An\u00a0obligate\u00a0piscivore\u00a0capable of consuming quite large prey in relation to its body size.","Newly-imported specimens may refuse to accept anything but live fishes although most can be weaned onto dead alternatives\u00a0once they recognise them as edible, and some even learn to accept dried foods.","Like the vast majority of\u00a0predatory\u00a0fishes this\u00a0species\u00a0should not be fed mammalian or avian meat such as beef heart or chicken.","Some of the lipids contained in these cannot be properly metabolised by the fish and may cause excess fat deposits and even organ degeneration.","Similarly there is no benefit in the use of \u2018feeder\u2019 fish such as livebearers or small goldfish which carry with them the risk of\u00a0parasite\u00a0or disease introduction and at any rate tend not have a high nutritional value unless properly conditioned beforehand."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful with anything too large to swallow and can be maintained in a\u00a0community\u00a0provided tankmates are chosen with care.","Aggressively\u00a0territorial\u00a0or very competitive\u00a0species\u00a0should be avoided with the best choices being placid fishes such as\u00a0Geophagus\u00a0spp.,\u00a0Acarichthys heckelii, medium-sized doradid or loricariid catfishes and characids from\u00a0genera\u00a0like\u00a0Ctenolucius,\u00a0Mylossoma\u00a0or\u00a0Myloplus.","This\u00a0species\u00a0is not normally aggressive towards conspecifics with juveniles in particular exhibiting a marked\u00a0schooling\u00a0instinct.","Older individuals tend to be more solitary but still group together from time-to-time, and it\u2019s best maintained in numbers of four or more.","One important point to note is that acestrorhynchids are cannibalistic given the opportunity so if buying a group or adding to an existing\u00a0school\u00a0try to ensure that all individuals are of comparable size."],"reproduction":["Apparently courtship and even spawning have been observed in aquaria but no fry raised.","Reports suggest that spawning occurs in midwater with the female remaining stationary while the male swims around her in a \u2018figure-of-eight\u2019 pattern.","The eggs are scattered in large numbers and parental care is non-existent."],"create_time":1426709913.44828}
