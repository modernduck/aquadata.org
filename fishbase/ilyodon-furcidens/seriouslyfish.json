A good flow of water is also appreciated as these fish prefer well-oxygenated water."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and unfussy they will accept most foods offered. They do consume large amounts of algae in their natural habitat so some greenstuffs should be included in the diet."],"behaviour":["","A peaceful fish and can be kept in a community tank provided the other species can cope with the lower temperatures required. Males may squabble amongst themselves but physical damage is rare."],"reproduction":["","Easy. Livebearer. Should be mated in a species aquarium and can be bred using a single pair or a group (flock spawning). The breeding tank should contain lots of plants. Goodeids breed in a slightly different way to other livebearers. Females do not store sperm as in many other livebearing species and must be mated separately for each brood of young. They also display no gravid spot.","Gestation takes between 7-8 weekss after which 5-50 huge (up to 1.5cm\u201d!) fry are produced. Sometimes these may have what appears to be an umbilical cord attached. This is quite normal (see below) and will disappear in 2-3 days. The fry are large enough to accept the same foods as the adults from birth and will be bold and outgoing from the outset, competing for food with any other fish in the aquarium. The parents rarely predate on the fry."],"create_time":1426712276.66834}
