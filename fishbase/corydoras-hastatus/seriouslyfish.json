Some habitats contain no vegetation while others feature dense growths of submerged grasses, aquatic or floating plants such as Eichhornia or Pistia\u00a0(see images).","Sympatric species in Paraguay include\u00a0Serrapinnus kriegi, Aphyocharax nattereri, and\u00a0Hyphessobrycon elachys\u00a0(C. hastatus\u00a0appears to form a mimetic relationship with these species; see \u2018Notes\u2019),\u00a0Hyphessobrycon eques,\u00a0Gymnocorymbus ternetzi,\u00a0Aphyocharax rathbuni,\u00a0Pyrrhulina australis,\u00a0Moenkhausia intermedia,\u00a0M.\u00a0sanctaefilomenae,\u00a0Otocinclus vittatus,\u00a0Satanoperca pappaterra,\u00a0Apistogramma trifasciata,\u00a0Laetacara dorsigera,\u00a0Mesonauta festivus,\u00a0Crenicichla lepidota, and\u00a0Eigenmannia virescens."],"maintenance":["Ideally use a substrate of fine sand, although rounded gravel is an acceptable alternative provided that it is kept scrupulously clean.","Other d\u00e9cor is largely down to personal choice, but some cover should be provided to give the fish security, ideally in the form of driftwood roots and branches, leaf litter and live vegetation at the water surface."],"diet":["Corydoras\u00a0spp. are foraging omnivores, and most will accept sinking dried foods as well as small live and frozen varieties such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex, etc.","C. hastatus\u00a0is slightly different in that it is partially adapted to forage on pelagic zooplankton (see \u2018Notes\u2019) meaning a diet containing plenty of live\u00a0Daphnia, Artemia, and suchlike is recommended.","Under no circumstances should they be expected to survive on \u2018left-overs\u2019 from other inhabitants of the aquarium or relied on to \u2018clean\u2019 the aquarium."],"behaviour":["Peaceful and gregarious. Should be maintained in a \u00a0group of at least 4-6 individuals, ideally 10 or more.","Care must be taken when selecting tankmates due to its small adult size;\u00a0it does\u00a0not compete well with much larger or more robust species in the confines of an aquarium."],"reproduction":["Can be bred in a similar fashion to many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species.","Use a ratio of two or more males per female if possible, and when the females are visibly full of eggs perform a large (50-70%) water change with\u00a0soft, cool\u00a0water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare arrangement."],"create_time":1426711215.19864}
