Will accept most foods"],"behaviour":["","Peaceful and can be combined with other small hard water tolerant fish."],"reproduction":["","Easy. Reproduces in the usual livebearer fashion. Males can be incredibly vigorous in their pursuit of females, so the breeding tank should be as large as possible with heavily planted areas in which the females can take shelter. The addition of some floating plants is also a good idea. The adult fish are less cannibalistic than many livebearer species and can be left in the aquarium if so desired. Each brood may contain 20-50 fry, and gestation takes between 4-6 weeks. The fry are large enough to take newly hatched brine shrimp or powdered flake from birth, although they take several months to exhibit adult colouration."],"create_time":1426712500.1279}
