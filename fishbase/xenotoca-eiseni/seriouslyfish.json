Will accept most foods offered."],"behaviour":["","Unpredictable. Some specimens prove good community tank inhabitants, while others may nip fins or simply attack and kill any other species present. It seems particularly adverse to catfish and has been known to strip the fins and eat the eyes of species such as Corydoras! Best kept in a species tank in our opinion."],"reproduction":["","Easy. Livebearer. Should be mated in a species aquarium and can be bred using a single pair or a group (flock spawning). The breeding tank should contain lots of plants. Goodeids breed in a slightly different way to other livebearers. Females do not store sperm as in many other livebearing species and must be mated separately for each brood of young. They also display no gravid spot.","Gestation takes between 7-8 weeks after which 5-50 large fry are produced. Sometimes these may have what appears to be an umbilical cord attached. This is quite normal (see below) and will disappear in 2-3 days. The fry are large enough to accept the same foods as the adults from birth and will be bold and outgoing from the outset, competing for food with any other fish in the aquarium. The parents rarely predate on the fry."],"create_time":1426714242.17479}
