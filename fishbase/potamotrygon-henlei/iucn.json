Improved information has resulted in the species being downlisted to Least Concern. <br/> <br/><em>Potamotrygon henlei</em> is endemic to the Tocantins-Araguaia River Basin, Brazil, with its primary distribution along the Rio Araguaia and lower Rio Tocantins. This species has not been negatively affected by the damming of the lower Tocantins, in fact there has been a significant population increase in the Tucuru\u00ed Reservoir (probably due to an increase in prey), hence this updated assessment of Least Concern. However, given that the species is collected in the unregulated ornamental fish trade, is subject to persecution in some areas and may be affected in other parts of its range by habitat degradation due to illegal mining activities, ongoing monitoring of these threats and its population status are required.","assessor":"Rincon, G.
