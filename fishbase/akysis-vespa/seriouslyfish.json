Leaf litter may also be used.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of organic pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive.","It also does best if there is a relatively high proportion of dissolved oxygen and decent water movement in the tank, and weekly water changes of 30-50% tank volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Akysis species are primarily nocturnal micropredators feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton.","They can be a little picky in the aquarium and may not accept dried foods although in some cases they will learn to take them over time.","At any rate they should always be offered regular meals of small live or frozen fare such as Artemia, Daphnia, bloodworm or glassworm, ideally after dark in order that they can demonstrate natural behaviour, though once settled most specimens will emerge at feeding times.","If the fish are very small you may need to chop the food accordingly."],"behaviour":["Not especially competitive and should not be kept with much larger or more aggressive fishes.","Miniature schooling cyprinids such as Boraras, Microdevario, Celestichthys or smaller rasborins\u00a0make good tankmates and if geography isn\u2019t an issue many similarly-sized characins and livebearers should also work.","Other similarly-sized akysid catfishes plus smaller sisorids such as Erithistes, Erethistoides, Hara, Pseudolaguvia and many Glyptothorax spp. are recommended for the lower levels.","In addition, many balitorid loaches from genera such as Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon and Homaloptera are also suitable, and\u00a0it\u2019s also proven to co-exist peacefully with\u00a0freshwater\u00a0shrimp.","It is not aggressive towards conspecifics and can be kept singly or in a group as preferred."],"reproduction":["A short report with images was published in the description paper (Ng and Kottelat, 2004), in which a successful spawning event in that species was apparently triggered by a significant decrease in temperature of around 44.6\u00b0F/7\u00b0C.","Several males were observed in pursuit of a gravid female, and the successful individual was allowed to wrap its body around that of the female at which point eggs and milt were released.","The eggs hatched 4 days post-spawn with the yolk sac fully-absorbed after 10 days.","Adult patterning was fully-developed after just 23 days."],"create_time":1426709979.86006}
