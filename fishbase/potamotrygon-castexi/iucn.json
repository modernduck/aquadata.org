There is no information available on the life history or population trends for this species. Environmental degradation and habitat loss are probably among the main threats. It does not appear to be taken as a food source, and is not often captured for the ornamental trade. Baseline research actions and habitat conservation are needed for this species. A revised assessment is recommended at such time as further information is available.","assessor":"Charvet-Almeida, P. & Pinto de Almeida, M.","evaluator":"Kyne, P.M., Cavanagh, R.D. & Fowler, S.L.
