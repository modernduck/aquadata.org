It\u2019s been recorded from Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, GuineaBissau, Gambia and Senegal. It occurs in a number of river systems over this range, including the Niger, Cross, Sanaga, Tano and Prah."],"habitat":["","It\u2019s usually found in heavily vegetated, slow moving parts of rivers and sluggish backwaters."],"maintenance":["","A dimly lit tank with areas of dense planting, pieces of driftwood and twisted roots is ideal for this species. Water movement should be minimal."],"diet":["","X. nigri is primarily carnivorous and will accept most meaty live and frozen foods. Some specimens will also accept pelleted varieties. We suggest a varied diet including lance fish, prawns, chopped mussel, earthworms, carnivore pellets etc."],"behaviour":["","An aggressive species that should only be kept with very robust species. It can be kept in a group when young, but as it matures it becomes increasingly territorial, particularly towards other knifefish but also towards any fish it takes a disliking to. While there are reports of it coexisting peacefully with other large fish such as arowana there are at least as many of it attacking the same species in other aquaria. We recommend that it is kept as a single specimen in its own tank or perhaps with a large loricariid such as Acanthicus adonis for company."],"reproduction":["","Not reported in captivity."],"create_time":1426713108.95111}
