Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","The water should be well-oxygenated with a little surface agitation advisable.","Do not add this fish to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry."],"diet":["Probably a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc.","Small insects such as crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use although it\u2019s best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish."],"behaviour":["Peaceful but somewhat unsuitable for the general\u00a0community\u00a0aquarium.","It\u2019s perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and diminutive, non-predatory cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle.","Males will also display their best colours and some fascinating behaviour as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["This species deposits its eggs among vegetation, these being guarded by the male during incubation.","In a\u00a0mature\u00a0set-up\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention but should you wish\u00a0to maximise yield a more controlled approach using a separate tank is preferable.","This can be arranged very simply with an air-powered sponge filter and some aquatic plants or synthetic alternative which should ideally be floating or reaching the water surface.","Nuptial males form small, temporary territories around an intended spawning site and attempt to attract sexually-active females in the vicinity.","The eggs may be laid on a broad plant leaf or if unavailable scattered among fine-leaved vegetation and the female(s) can be removed post-spawning, leaving the male to guard and tend the brood.","Incubation is 36-72 hours and once the eggs begin to hatch parental care ceases and the male should also be removed as he may begin to eat the fry.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them.","As with other Copella spp. growth is very slow."],"create_time":1426711086.45888}
