The type specimens were collected from the Jelai Bila river basin at Nataik Sedawak, presumably a settlement of some kind, near the town of Sukamara in the Indonesian province of Kalimantan Tengah (Central Kalimantan).","The full type locality is \u2018Sungei Jelai Bila basin, 2\u00b041\u2019S, 111\u00b013\u2019E, Nataik Sedawak, about 30 kilometers south of Sukamara, Kalimantan Tengah, Borneo\u2019.","Its range extends westwards from the Jelai Bila watershed whereas that of the congener\u00a0B. brigittae, with which it may occur sympatrically there (see \u2018Notes\u2019),\u00a0extends east."],"habitat":["Inhabits black water streams and rivers associated with ancient forest peat swamps. The water is stained brown due to the release of tannins and other chemicals released by decomposing organic matter and the substrate scattered with fallen leaves, twigs and branches.","Such environments characteristically contain very soft (negligible hardness), acidic (pH as low as 4.0) water and are often dimly-lit due to the forest canopy above. These biotopes are under serious threat across much of Southeast Asia\u00a0from rubber/palm oil plantations, building developments and other human activities."],"maintenance":["Best maintained in a densely-planted aquarium\u00a0and is an excellent choice for the carefully-aquascaped set-up. The addition of some floating plants and roots or branches to diffuse the light entering the\u00a0tank\u00a0also seems to be appreciated and adds a more natural feel.","Filtration does not need to be particularly strong as it mostly hails from sluggish waters and may struggle if there is a fast current.","To see it at its best a\u00a0biotope-style set-up can also make an interesting project. A soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0is probably the best choice to which can be added roots and branches, placed in such a way that plenty of shady spots are formed. If you can\u2019t find driftwood of the desired shape common beech or oak is safe to use if thoroughly dried and stripped of bark.","The addition of dried leaf litter further emphasises the natural feel and encourage growth of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These tiny creatures can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry\u00a0whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are thought to be beneficial for\u00a0blackwater\u00a0fish\u00a0species. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","Fairly dim lighting should be used to simulate the conditions the fish would encounter in nature. You could add aquatic plants that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum pteropus,\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp. Do not introduce any\u00a0Boraras\u00a0sp. to a biologically-immature aquarium as they can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry."],"diet":["As with other Boraras species it\u2019s likely to be a micropredator feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans and other zooplankton in nature.","In the aquarium it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should not be fed these exclusively. Daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia, Artemia along with good quality flakes and granules will result in the best colouration and encourage the fish to come into breeding condition."],"behaviour":["This\u00a0species\u00a0is very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature. It will do best when maintained alone or with other diminutive\u00a0species\u00a0such as\u00a0Microdevario,\u00a0Sundadanio,\u00a0Danionella,\u00a0Eirmotus,\u00a0Trigonostigma, pygmy\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0and small Loricariids such as\u00a0Otocinclus.","It also makes an ideal companion for shy anabantoids such as\u00a0Sphaerichthys,\u00a0Parosphromenus\u00a0or the more diminutive\u00a0Betta\u00a0species, and in a planted set-up can be housed alongside\u00a0freshwater\u00a0shrimp of the\u00a0genera\u00a0Caridina\u00a0and\u00a0Neocaridina.","It\u2019s a schooling\u00a0species\u00a0by nature and really should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens. Maintaining it in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but will result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Males will also display their best colours and some interesting behaviour as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["Like many small cyprinids this\u00a0species\u00a0is an\u00a0egg-scattering, continuous spawner that exhibits zero\u00a0parental care. That is to say when in good condition and in the presence of both males and females relatively small numbers of eggs will be laid daily. In a well-furnished,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is therefore possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without human intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of\u00a0fry\u00a0a slightly more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more small, perhaps 10-15 litre, containers should also be set up.","These should be very dimly lit with the\u00a0base\u00a0either left bare or covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plant can pass through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works very well. The water itself should be of\u00a0pH\u00a05.0-6.5, 1-5\u00b0H with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above.","A decent-sized clump of Java moss or other fine-leaved plant should also be added filling perhaps half the available space. Filtration is not really necessary but you can use a small, air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0if you prefer.","Two or three pairs of well-conditioned adult fish should then be introduced to each container. It is wise to make the transfer slowly in order to avoid excessive levels of stress but if conditions are to their liking they should begin to\u00a0spawn\u00a0the following morning.","While this\u00a0species\u00a0certainly will eat its eggs it appears not to actively hunt for them as is the case with many small cyprinids. Once\u00a0spawning\u00a0has commenced it should continue on a daily basis.","The\u00a0pair(s) should be left\u00a0in situ\u00a0for no more than a couple of days before being removed as the first eggs should hatch by the second day after the initial\u00a0spawning. The tiny young will survive on their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs for another 24 hours or so after which they will require\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or other microscopic food.","After a week to ten days they should be large enough to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii/microworm\u00a0etc. As the days pass additional\u00a0fry\u00a0should start to appear from later\u00a0spawning\u00a0events. It\u2019s best to wait a week or two before starting to perform small water changes in order to avoid unduly shocking the young fish."],"create_time":1426710651.58716}
