It is assessed as Endangered on the basis of a single location (major threat of introduced predators), restricted Extent of Occurrence, and a decline in population size as a result of the impacts of introduced species, suspected over-harvesting for the aquarium trade, and the impacts of pollution. The area of open water in the lake has declined in recent years (Sidle <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al. </span>2007), a situation that has been exacerbated by recent draughts (Htwe 2010). If the trend continues the species may qualify for a higher threat category.<span style=\"background-color: red;\"><br/></span>","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Allen, D.J. & Kullander, S.O."}]
