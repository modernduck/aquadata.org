Type locality is the falls of Cachoeira do Teot\u00f4nio, situated on the rio Madeira in\u00a0Rond\u00f4nia state, northwestern Brazil, a whitewater cataract through which water flows at an enormous volume and rate.","It\u2019s also been recorded in the Caquet\u00e1, and Putomayo basins in Colombia, plus the Ucayali and Mara\u00f1on watersheds in Peru. The majority of those seen in the aquarium trade are apparently captured around the city of Iquitos in Loreto Region of the latter."],"habitat":["Inhabits main river channels containing white-coloured water with a high proportion of dissolved solids, low transparency, high dissolved oxygen (around 5 mg/l), and neutral pH. Water flow is typically strong, and adults are often associated with cataracts and stretches of rapids.","While adults appear to be obligate inhabitants of main river channels, juveniles measuring 20 \u2013 50 mm are frequently collected for the aquarium trade from small tributary drainages around Iquitos in Peru, especially in areas where rice is cultivated when water levels are low. These are frequently grown on to a size of 150 \u2013 180 mm in commercial or artisanal facilities in order to obtain a better price from ornamental fish exporters."],"maintenance":["The choice of d\u00e9cor is as much down to personal preference as anything else though a carefully-aquascaped, planted set-up is obviously out of the question.","A sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with some large chunks of driftwood, or a completely bare arrangement are perhaps the most-favoured options in privately-owned aquaria, but provided water quality is maintained and lighting not too bright this\u00a0species\u00a0is relatively unfussy.","An enormous, reliable\u00a0filter\u00a0system, rigorous maintenance regime comprising weekly water changes of 50-70% tank volume, and provision of highly-oxygenated water with plenty of movement should be considered mandatory."],"diet":"Almost entirely\u00a0piscivorous\u00a0preying on smaller fishes captured in the water column in nature, though most specimens readily adapt to dead alternatives such as prawn/shrimp, mussel, squid,\u00a0whitebait, strips of larger white fish, etc., in aquaria. Adults require just a single meal per week at most.","behaviour":"Only keep with\u00a0species\u00a0large enough to avoid predation and that require similar environmental conditions.","reproduction":"Unrecorded in captivity. In nature spawning is known to commence at the end of the dry season with early growth occurring between June and November. Unlike some members of the genus this species does not appear to undergo pan-Amazonian migrations as part of its life cycle.","create_time":1426710737.83268}
