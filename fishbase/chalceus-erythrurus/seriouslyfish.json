Make sure the tank cover is very well-fitting, as it is a renowned jumper."],"diet":["","Feeds primarily on insects and aquatic crustaceans in nature. While dried foods are usually accepted, a good proportion of the diet should contain meaty foods such as prawns, mussel, bloodworm, chopped earthworms etc."],"behaviour":["","It does best when kept either as a single specimen, or in a group with more than 6 fish. In smaller groups, the fish tend to scrap with one another. Other than this, it is a good addition to many larger communities. Tankmates can include similarly-sized characins such as Leporinus, Metynnis, Mylossoma and Brycon sp., large Loricariids, Pimelodiids, and cichlids such as Geophagus or Satanoperca sp. Try to avoid other surface-dwelling species unless the tank is huge."],"reproduction":["","Not achieved in the hobby to date.
