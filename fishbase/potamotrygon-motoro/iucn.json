Although this is the most abundant and widespread endemic ray species of the Parano-plata Basin, it is poorly known and its status is uncertain due to the sparse life history and population data available for this species. Further study and a new assessment in the near future is highly recommended, due to this species' limited geographic range and the major impacts to its freshwater habitat.","assessor":"Drioli, M. & Chiaramonte, G.","evaluator":"Musick, J.A. & Fowler, S.L.
