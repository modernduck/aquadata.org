Provide cover by planting some areas of the tank densely, along with some floating vegetation. Rocks and driftwood can also be used. It is a freshwater species and does not require the addition of salt to it\u2019s tank."],"diet":["","Relatively unfussy, and will accept most live, frozen and dried foods."],"behaviour":["","P. siamensis is peaceful and shy, and should not be combined with vigorous or aggressive species. Good tankmates include barbs, livebearers, smaller rainbowfish and loaches. It is a shoaling species and will not do well if kept singly or in pairs. Aim for a group of at least 6. Males do become somewhat territorial when spawning but physical damage is rare."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in captivity, although the process is probably similar to that of P. ranga."],"create_time":1426713158.74376}
