So far, it has been recorded only from the Drysdale and Carson Rivers in the Kimberley area."],"habitat":["","Slow-moving areas of these rivers. It\u2019s also found isolated in surrounding pools during the dry season. The water in these habitats is typically very clear."],"maintenance":["","Unlke many other members of the genus, the natural habitat of M. gracilis is quite sparse and rocky. A biotope aquarium would thus consist of a gravel substrate with smooth, water-worn rocks, and possibly the odd beech branch or two. However the fish are equally as happy in a densely planted setup. In either case, water movement should be kept to a minimum."],"diet":["","Unfussy and will accept most dried, frozen and live foods. Regular feedings of the latter will help to ensure the fish exhibit their best colours."],"behaviour":["","This is one of the smaller rainbowfish and is very peaceful. Good tankmates include other similarly-sized rainbowfish, characins, danios, barbs, freshwater gobies and catfish such as Corydoras. It can also be kept with many species of Rift Lake cichlid, due to its water requirements. ","The slender rainbowfish can be quite skittish and does far better when kept in a shoal of at least 6-8, preferably more. The males will also be encouraged to display their best colours in the company of conspecifics."],"reproduction":["","No information available, although we assume it has been achieved. It probably breeds in a similar fashion to other species in the genus, although the lack of aquatic vegetation in its natural waters may indicate that it scatters its eggs directly onto the substrate, as opposed to among the leaves of plants."],"create_time":1426712630.32507}
