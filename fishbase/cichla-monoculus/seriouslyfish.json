Large pieces of bogwood and robust plants are recommended. These are large messy fish and require filtration that is up to the job. External or sump filtration should be considered."],"diet":["","Piscivorous in nature.

Can be kept in species groups or with other large species such as arowana, stingrays, large cats and other large cichlids. An extremely large tank is required to achieve this with any degree of success.
