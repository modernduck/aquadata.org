A substrate of sand is the best option. Obviously, powerful filtration is required in order to deal with the large amounts of waste produced by this predatory fish."],"diet":["","Will accept dried foods such as pellets but these should not form the basis of the diet. Although this fish is a piscivore by nature, it can easily be trained to accept dead foods in aquaria. Prawns, mussel, cockle, lancefish etc. are all ideal."],"behaviour":["","A predatory species with a large mouth that should not be kept with fish under around 5\u2033 in length as they will be eaten. This is particularly true for mbuna, the natural diet of this fish. It is peaceful with species too large to eat, and can be combined with other large haps, but do not keep it with species requiring a vegetarian diet. ","The male fish become territorial during spawning. Several females should be kept per male, and only one male kept, unless the tank is enormous."],"reproduction":["","Not known to have spawned in aquaria. Maternal mouthbrooder. In nature males excavate large, crater-like pits in the substrate and defend these against other males. Spawning occurs in these pits. Brood care by the female is known to last for some time in this species."],"create_time":1426714172.36581}
