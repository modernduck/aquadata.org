It is widely distributed and&#160; common throughout its range, where it occurs in moving waters with gravel to stone substrate and  aquatic vegetation. Anthropogenic modification of river morphology impacts this species by reducing or interrupting fast water flow. Logging, deforestation and agriculture also occur in the area, with associated impacts on the aquatic environment expected. This species is assessed as Least Concern as it is widely distributed and seems less sensitive to minor habitat changes compared to species with similar habitat preferences.","assessor":"Kottelat, M.","evaluator":"Allen, D. & Smith, K."}]
