The Iriri is a major tributary of the Xingu and B. xanthellus has also been recorded along its mid-to-lower course with that population coded L177."],"habitat":"Occurs predominantly in whitewater rapids with young specimens observed to congregate under flat rocks at the bottom of shallow stretches whereas adults are found under and among submerged rocks and boulders. Other species recorded in the same habitats include\u00a0Baryancistrus aff. niveatus,\u00a0Ancistrus spp., Oligancistrus punctatissimus, Oligancistrus sp.Parancistrus nudiventris, Pseudancistrus sp.,\u00a0Scobinancistrus aureatus, S. cf. pariolispos, and Hypostomus spp.","maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions but largely unsuitable for the \u2018general\u2019?\u00a0community aquarium. We recommend keeping it in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0gravel\u00a0and some large water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, roots and tough aquatic plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis,?\u00a0or?\u00a0Anubias?\u00a0spp., which can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor. Bright lighting will promote the growth of?\u00a0aufwuchs?\u00a0upon which the fish will?\u00a0graze.","Like many?\u00a0species?\u00a0that naturally inhabit running waters it\u2019s intolerant to the accumulation of?\u00a0organic?\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water at all times in order to thrive. It\u2019s also essential to provide sufficient levels of?\u00a0dissolved oxygen?\u00a0and water movement using a combination of canister filters, powerheads, etc., particularly if the aim is for the fish to breed. Weekly water changes of 40-70% should also be considered mandatory."],"diet":["Gut analyses of wild specimens revealed the diet to be composed chiefly of algae, particularly diatoms and filamentous genera such as Spirogyra?\u00a0alongside smaller amounts of invertebrates such as chironomids and bryozoans.","In the aquarium aufwuchs should thus be allowed to colonise all surfaces except the viewing pane in order that the fish can browse naturally although the diet should of course be supplemented with high-quality sinking dried foods (preferably with added vegetable content), live or frozen bloodworm and similar, plus slices of fresh fruit and vegetables and the occasional defrosted prawn or shrimp.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of pur\u00e9ed fish food, shellfish, fruit and vegetables, are also proven to work well and in many ways represent the ideal staple diet since the ingredients can be altered at will, and when made well such foods contain a greater concentration and diversity of nutrients than any of the other options.","Baryancistrus?\u00a0spp. are often under-nourished and/or suffering from health issues post-importation and may require an extended period of quarantine and acclimatisation. They also have a relatively high metabolic rate and? may initially require several meals per day."],"behaviour":["Juveniles are relatively peaceful but males in particular become highly intolerant of?\u00a0conspecifics as they age and typically aggressive towards any other fish viewed as a territorial threat. It\u2019s therefore best kept with?\u00a0species that inhabit other areas of the tank?\u00a0with medium-to-large sized characids particularly suitable.","In very large aquaria you may be able to combine it with other catfishes or maintain a group provided care is taken to provide sufficient territorial space and visual barriers when laying out the d\u00e9cor."],"reproduction":"The possibly conspecific L081 has been bred on a single occasion. Any successful attempt is likely to depend on providing a large tank, well-oxygenated water and an excellent diet.","create_time":1426710521.88487}
