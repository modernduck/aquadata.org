locality is \u2018White Cloud Mountain, Kwangtung, China\u2019, referring to\u00a0White Cloud Mountain (also known as Mount Baiyun or Baiyunshan) a few miles north of the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China and this species is probably restricted to the Pearl River Delta region.","It appears to been extirpated from the \u2018mountain\u2019 which is actually a collection of thirty or so peaks and now a popular tourist resort complete with cable car access, hotels and public parks.","Between 1980 and 2001 it was not\u00a0recorded anywhere at all leading to fears of its extinction\u00a0but\u00a0a handful of relict\u00a0populations have been discovered close to the type locality and at isolated spots in coastal Guangdong province (in the prefecture-level city of Shanwei) and Quang Ninh province, northeastern Vietnam.","The latter shares a border with Guangxi province, China, and the fish were found in a coastal stream draining into the world famous Ha Long Bay.","In 2007 an additional\u00a0population was discovered on Hainan Island, Hainan province, which is separated from Guangdong by the 30 km wide Qiongzhou Strait (Chan and Chen, 2009).","Questions regarding the genetic status of the Shanwei, Hainan, and Vietnamese populations have been raised as they appear to have been segregated for a considerable period of time meaning phylogenetic studies could yield interesting results.","It\u2019s considered an endangered species by governmental agencies in China and features in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, in which it is listed as a \u2018second class state protected\u2019 animal, but has not been evaluated by the IUCN at time of writing.","Reintroduction programmes using captive-bred fish have been implemented but we\u2019ve been unable to obtain details as to their success or failure.","This precarious conservation status is unlikely to affect the aquarium hobby because all the fish on sale are bred on a commercial basis."],"habitat":["Little published information exists but one of the populations rediscovered close to the type locality in Guangdong inhabits a sluggish, spring-fed mountain stream with clear, shallow water and dense growths of aquatic vegetation (Yi et al. 2004).","Macropodus opercularis and introduced Gambusia affinis were the only other fish species recorded.","The Hainan Island fish occupy a clear, slow-moving coastal stream and its tributaries with substrates\u00a0of sand, pebbles and leaf litter and maximum water depth of only 23.6\u2033/60cm even during the wet season.","They were observed swimming in schools in calmer zones and backwaters close to patches of dense, trailing marginal vegetation.","PH was 6.4 with low hardness values and plant species\u00a0included Blyxa japonica, Rotala rotundifolia, Ludwigia prostrata, Ceratopteris thalictroides and Limnophila sp.","Sympatric fishes were\u00a0Puntius semifasciolatus, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Macropodus opercularis, and Channa gachua as well as non-native Gambusia and Oreochromis."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not especially critical though it tends to show better colouration in a heavily-planted set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The addition of some floating plants, driftwood roots or branches, and leaf litter\u00a0also seems to be appreciated and adds a more natural feel.","Filtration does not need to be particularly strong though it does seem to appreciate a degree of water movement and will also do well in a hill stream-type set-up."],"diet":["Stomach analyses of wild specimens have revealed it to be a micropredator feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans and other zooplankton.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0alongside good quality dried flakes and granules, at least some of which should include additional plant or algal content."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful indeed and an ideal resident of a well-maintained community\u00a0 set-up\u00a0provided its temperature requirements are considered.","Other species that enjoy comparable conditions include Pethia conchonius, P. padamya, \u2018Puntius\u2018 semifasciolatus, and\u00a0Macropodus opercularis (it occurs sympatrically with the latter two\u00a0in nature) but it doesn\u2019t make a suitable companion for goldfish despite often being sold as such.","In a stream-style tank\u00a0it can also be combined with rheophilic species from genera such as Danio, Devario, and Garra as well as many loaches.","It\u2019s a schooling fish by nature and ideally a group comprising 10+ specimens should be purchased.","Maintaining such numbers will not only make individuals less nervous but result in a more effective, natural-looking display, and males will display their best colours as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["Like many small cyprinids this species is an egg-scattering, continuous spawner that exhibits no parental care.","That is to say when the fish are in good condition they will spawn often and when a group is maintained alone in a densely-planted, mature aquarium or outdoor container small numbers of fry usually start to appear without further intervention.","Should a more controlled approach be required a separate, smaller aquarium\u00a0can be set up.","This should be dimly-lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced, and\u00a0spawning\u00a0should take place the following morning.","An alternative is to spawn the fish in a group with half a dozen specimens of each\u00a0sex\u00a0being a good number, although a larger aquarium may be necessary.","In either situation the adults will probably eat the eggs given the chance and should be removed after 2-3 days maximum.","The eggs should hatch in 48-60 hours and once free-swimming the\u00a0fry\u00a0may require an\u00a0infusoria-grade food until large enough to accept\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, and suchlike."],"create_time":1426713990.64027}
