Air-breather that can withstand high temperatures, which enables it to survive in stagnant areas; even known to aestivate; lethal temperature is 35.2\u00b0C (Ref. 46234).  A voracious and opportunist feeder, it subsists on fishes including other sport fishes, frogs, crayfish, insects, and shrimps.  It uses scent as much as sight and captures food by means of gulping water.  Males are always smaller than females which live longer.  Apparently somewhat migratory during spawning season (Ref. 4639).  Eggs are adhesive, attached to decaying vegetation and upright weeds (Ref. 4639).  Larvae are found in nest, remaining attached to roots or lying on bottom until adhesive organ is absorbed, thereafter in tight \"swarm\" guarded by male parent outside nest (Ref. 4639).  A &#39;living fossil&#39; and lone survivor species of Family Amiidae.","agents":[{"full_name":"Rainer Froese","homepage":"http://www.fishbase.de/rfroese","role":"recorder"},{"full_name":"FishBase","homepage":"http://www.fishbase.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":"Page, L.M. and B.M.
