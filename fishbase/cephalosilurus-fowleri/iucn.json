Therefore the species is assessed as Least Concern.  The species has been found recently in even relatively degraded parts of the Sao Francisco basin.  It is important that further research is conducted at appropriate times to locate this nocturnal catfish in order to establish a better picture of its distribution and abundance.","assessor":"Reis, R & Lima, F.","evaluator":"Collen, B., Darwall, W., Ram, M. & Smith, K.
