It is commonly known by its generic name, gambusia, and sometimes called the western mosquitofish to distinguish it from the closely related eastern mosquitofish (<i>G. holbrooki</i>), which according to ITIS is actually a subspecies of <i>G. affinis</i>, rather than its own species; this has complicated classification of <i>G. affinis</i>).  The name \"mosquitofish\" was given because the diet of this fish predominantly consists of large amounts of mosquito larvae (as well as other invertebrate larvae); an adult female can consume hundreds in a day.  Hardy to a variety of temperatures, salinities and oxygen levels, mosquitofish have spread through many parts of the world in introductions attempting to reduce mosquito populations.  Although this biocontrol did play a major role in containing malaria in South America, Russia and the Ukraine in the 1920s, they are now recognized the Global Invasive Species Database as one of the world\u2019s 100 worst invasive species.  This voracious, aggressive predator has extirpated and eliminated many native species, is extremely hard to eradicate, and is now a pest in fresh and brackish waters around the world.  Mosquitofish are small; females reach an overall length of 7 centimeters and males at a length of 4 centimeters (1.6 in).  Like all other New World members of this family, <i>G. affinis</i> gives birth to live young.\r\n\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.fishbase.org/summary/Gambusia-affinis.html\">Froese and Pauly 2011</a>; <a href=\"http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=165896&amp;print_version=PRT&amp;source=to_print\">ITIS 2011</a>; <a href=\"http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=126&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=&amp;lang=EN\">IUCN/SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group 2010</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_mosquitofish&amp;oldid=475511554\">Wikipedia 2012</a>)\r\n","agents":[{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"provider"}],"references":["Froese, R. and D.

The relatively large head is flattened on the upper surface, and the small mouth is superior (upturned) and protrusible. The eyes are large relative to the body. Dorsal and caudal fins are rounded and no lateral line is visible (IGGS 2006).The body is usually greenish olive to brown above, grey-blue on the sides, and silvery-white below. The body has a characteristic diamond or net pattern on the body formed by dark pigment at the scale margins. Small black dots are also usually present on the body and tail. A small dark bar below the eye also aids in identification and a black peritoneum (abdominal cavity lining) can often be observed through the belly in living specimens. Melanistic (black or nearly black) individuals are common in some populations. The dorsal fin is single and has only soft rays. Individuals typically have 7-9 soft dorsal rays, 8-10 anal fins, and 29-32 lateral line scales (Hoese and Moore 1977, Robins et al 1986, IGGS 2006).The species is sexually dimorphic, with adult males being considerably smaller than females and also possessing a gonopodium-an elongated anal fin that functions as an intromittent organ for sperm transfer during mating. Mature females have a distinct gravid spot located on the posterior abdomen above the rear of the anal fin (Hoese and Moore 1977, GLAVCD undated).","agents":[{"full_name":"J.

They may be found in fresh water as far inland as Illinois (Ray et al. 1986).Mosquitofish now also occur throughout much of the world as a result of intentional and non-intentional introductions beginning approximately 100 years ago. Intentional introductions have largely been for purposes of mosquito control, although G. affinis is not considered to be any more effective against mosquitoes than most native mosquito-eating species (ISSG 2006). Gambusia affinis is a common inhabitant of lower salinity portions of the lagoon and associated upland freshwater systems. Salt marshes, mosquito impoundments, and mesohaline seagrass beds are among the habitats utilized by this species.","agents":[{"full_name":"J.

In south Florida, Gambusia affinis co-occurs with the congeneric mangrove gambusia, G. rhizophorae. The latter species is not known from as far north as the IRL however (Ray et al. 1986).The characteristic net-like scale pattern and the poster origin of the dorsal fin relative to the anal fin are typically sufficient to distinguish Gambusia from the co-occurring poeciliid, the sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna (Hoese and Moore 1977).Poeciliid fishes can generally be differentiated from the potentially similar looking cyprinodontids (the killifishes) by the presence of either a gravid spot (mature females) or an intromittent organ (occurring on mature males) on the former.","agents":[{"full_name":"J.

As the common name suggests, they are voracious consumers of mosquito larvae. All sizes and ages of mosquitofish feed on mosquito larvae, and a large female mosquitofish can consume hundreds of larvae a day (GLAVCD undated). Rajasekharan and Chowdaiah (1972) demonstrated that G. affinis could discern between different species of simultaneously presented mosquito larvae and preferentially consumed certain species based on a number of factors facilitating prey capture, including size, vertical position in the water column, and the tendency of larvae to clump in groups.Baber and Babbitt (2004) indicate Gambusia () are capable of effectively consuming tadpoles of two Florida amphibians, significantly impacting prey density. In addition, G. affinis is capable of foraging effectively in densely vegetated areas that would likely provide cover from larger predatory fish.Mosquitofish, particularly where it occurs as a non-native, also prey heavily on the eggs and young of co-occurring fish species. Predators: Britton and Moser (1988) report that G. affinis represents a significant portion of the diets of four species of Camargue herons they studied. The authors also indicate that female fish are preferentially consumed over the smaller males, in apparent concordance with optimal foraging theory. Parasites: Gambusia affinis has been discovered to be one of several primarily freshwater fishes that serve as intermediate hosts of nematodes of genus Falcaustra, adults of whom typically infest reptile or amphibian hosts (Moravec et al. 1995). Habitats: Gambusia affinis occurs in a variety of freshwater and in protected brackish environments. It preferentially occupies vegetated habitats, including salt marsh and seagrass beds (Ray 1986). It is benthic and non-migratory in habit and is most often encountered in standing or slow-flowing waters (FishBase 2004, IGGS 2006).Preference experiments by Casterlin and Reynolds (1977) revealed that mosquitofish selectively occupied areas with subsurface vegetation but avoided floating cover that restricted access to the water surface. Activity Time: Lined sole are typically active in the evening hours, spending much of the daytime hours buried in shallow sand.","agents":[{"full_name":"J.
