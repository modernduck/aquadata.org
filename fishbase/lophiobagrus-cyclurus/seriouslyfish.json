{"images":[],"distribution":["","Endemic to Lake Tanganyika."],"habitat":["","It hides among rocks during daytime hours, emerging to forage under cover of darkness."],"maintenance":["","Should be housed in a Lake Tanganyika biotope setup, with piles of rocks arranged to form caves in which it can seek refuge. Provide areas of open water for swimming. Dim lighting will encourage it to be seen more often."],"diet":["","Omnivorous and unfussy. Frozen, live and dried foods are all accepted."],"behaviour":["","Although very small fish will be eaten, it will live happily in most communities of Tanganyikan catfish and cichlids. It can also be kept in small species groups without problems."],"reproduction":["","Rarely bred in aquaria but it has been achieved. Apparently, the breeding pair lay their eggs in a rocky cave, and the eggs hatch in around 4-5 days. No extended parental care has been recorded, so if you do get a spawn, it may be wise to remove the parents/fry to a separate tank."],"create_time":1426712515.56731}
