The Yu later joins the Xi Jiang, a major tributary of the famous Zhu Jiang (Pearl River).","S. robusta has been recorded from several other tributary drainages of the Zhu Jiang system including the Liu Jiang and Gui Jiang. The Zhu drains most of Guangxi plus Guangdong province, with parts of its upper reaches extending into parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, plus northern Vietnam.","The area is one of the most populous and industrialised in China so much of the main Zhu channel is now highly polluted, particularly in its lower reaches."],"habitat":["Not much information is available but presumably inhabits moderate-to-slowly flowing stretches of streams or main river channels with clear water plus substrates of sand and rocks, as do other members of the genus.","Sympatric species often include Tor brevifilis, Onychostoma ovale, O. lini, O. gerlachi, Cirrhinus molitorella, Luciocyprinus langsoni, Saurogobio dabryi, Cobitis sinensis, Parabotia fasciata, Sinibotia reevesae, and Silurus asotus."],"maintenance":["All botiid loaches need a well-structured set-up although the actual choice of d\u00e9cor is more-or-less down to personal taste.","A natural-style arrangement could include a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of\u00a0sand\u00a0or fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0with plenty of smooth, water-worn rocks and pebbles plus driftwood and branches.","Lighting can be relatively subdued and plants able to grow in such conditions like\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be added if you wish. These have an added benefit as they can be attached to pieces of d\u00e9cor in such a way as to provide useful shade.","Otherwise be sure to provide plenty of cover as botiids are inquisitive and seems to enjoy exploring their surroundings. Rocks, wood, flower pots and\u00a0aquarium\u00a0ornaments can be used in whichever combination to achieve the desired effect.","Bear in mind that these fish like to squeeze themselves into small gaps and crevices so items with sharp edges should be omitted, and any gaps or holes small enough for a fish to become trapped should be filled in with\u00a0aquarium-grade silicone sealant. A tightly-fitting cover is also essential as they may jump at times.","Sinibotia\u00a0spp. appear to prefer faster-flowing water than most botiids and can be maintained in larger hill stream-style set-ups, though provided the water is well-oxygenated with a degree of flow very turbulent conditions aren\u2019t mandatory.","They are however intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water in order to thrive. For this reason they should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapt most easily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria.","In terms of maintenance weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Likely to be a benthic predator hunting insects, crustaceans, and smaller fishes in nature.","Captive specimens aren\u2019t fussy but should be offered a varied diet comprising live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex, chopped shellfish, earthworms and good quality, sinking dried foods.","Once settled into the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0feeding behaviour can be somewhat vigorous with the fish often ascending into midwater to feed."],"behaviour":["This\u00a0species\u00a0is typically reclusive and tends to occupy quieter areas of the\u00a0tank\u00a0or remain under cover when not feeding. It\u2019s also very peaceful and safe to keep with many other fishes provided they can cope with the same environmental conditions.","Particularly suitable tankmates include\u00a0pelagic\u00a0cyprinids such as many\u00a0Devario,\u00a0Rasbora, \u2018Puntius\u2018,\u00a0Mystacoleucus, and some\u00a0Danio\u00a0spp., while in larger tanks members of\u00a0Barilius,\u00a0Luciosoma,\u00a0Balantiocheilos, and\u00a0Barbonymus\u00a0become options.","In terms of other bottom-dwellers this\u00a0species\u00a0should do well alongside most\u00a0Botia\u00a0and\u00a0Sinibotia\u00a0spp. and in very large tanks,\u00a0Chromobotia macracanthus.","Many balitorid, cobitid, gastromyzontid and nemacheilid loaches are also possibilities as are members of\u00a0Epalzeorhynchos,\u00a0Crossocheilus, and\u00a0Garra\u00a0plus many catfishes.","As always, thorough research prior to selecting a\u00a0community\u00a0of fishes is the best way to avoid problems.","Sinibotia\u00a0spp. are\u00a0gregarious\u00a0and seemingly form complex social hierarchies, therefore 3-4 specimens should be the minimum purchase.","When kept singly they occasionally become withdrawn or aggressive towards similarly-shaped fishes, and if only a\u00a0pair\u00a0or trio are purchased the dominant individual may stress the other(s) to the extent that they stop feeding."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded in aquaria; presumably a seasonal, possibly migratory spawner in nature.","create_time":1426713831.57263}
