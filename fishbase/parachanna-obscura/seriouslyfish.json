Its range also extends inland into Burkina Faso and Niger and on across the continent through Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo and finally into Sudan."],"habitat":["","Tends to be associated with dense marginal vegetation and swampy lowland floodplains."],"maintenance":["","Loosely planted tank with floating cover and open areas for swimming."],"diet":["","Almost exclusively carnivorous, preying on smaller fish and invertebrates in nature. Analyses of the stomach contents of wild fish also revelealed a certain amount of plant matter and other detritus, but these were probably ingested via the gut contents of prey items. Carnivorous and enjoys live foods but adapts well to frozen food such as prawns, bloodworm and mussel in captivity. Dried foods are not usually accepted."],"behaviour":["","Predatory. Do not keep with fish less than 2/3 it\u2019s body size as it will view them as food. Suggested tankmates (if any) are similarly sized robust fish such as polypterus, datnoides, larger catfish, loricariids and some cichlids but their safety is not guaranteed. We have seen pictures of plecos with no remaining finnage as a result of keeping them with P. obscura. This species is best kept alone."],"reproduction":["","Possible but unlikely. Cave-spawners/egg-scatterers."],"create_time":1426713119.26287}
