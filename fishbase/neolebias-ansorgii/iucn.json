It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for central Africa. In western Africa, the species has fairly wide distribution (EOO slightly exceeding 20,000 km2) with widespread threats, particularly from agricultural, urban and forestry developments. Should the EOO decline through loss of sub-populations then the species might qualify as Vulnerable under criterion B, and it has therefore been assessed as Near Threatened.","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Olaosebikan, B.D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
