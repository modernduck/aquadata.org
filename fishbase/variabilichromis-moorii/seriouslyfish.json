{"images":[],"distribution":["","Endemic to Lake Tanganyika. It is found only in the southern part of the lake."],"habitat":["","It inhabits shallow water around rocky shorelines."],"maintenance":["","Much of the aquarium should contain piles of rocks arranged to form caves with small areas of open water between. A sandy substrate is the best type of substrate to give to this fish."],"diet":["","Live and frozen foods should comprise a large proportion of the diet. Dried foods can be fed, but less often. The diet should include some vegetable matter, such as a good quality spirulina flake."],"behaviour":["","A relatively peaceful species even when spawning. It can be maintained successfully with other small to medium-sized Tanganyikan cichlids that occupy different areas of the tank such as Cyprichromis species. Other rockdwellers such as Julidochromis or Altolamprologus are possibilities if the tank is large enough and sufficient territories are provided. ","It should not be kept with mbuna or other boisterous species and should be maintained in pairs as the fish form monogamous bonds with their partners. Pairs are territorial towards conspecifics and only a single pair should be kept unless the tank is very large."],"reproduction":["","Possible. Bi-parental cave spawner. We suggest purchasing a group of young fish and allowing them to pair off naturally. Once a pair forms the other fish should be removed from the aquarium as the pair will remain together for life. The aquarium should be at least 48\u2033 in length and set up as suggested above. The pH should be around 8.2-9.0 and the temperature 77-80\u00b0F.","The pair will spawn very secretively in a cave, with the female laying her eggs scattered on the wall or roof of it. It is often very difficult to tell if they have spawned until the fry are seen. Once spawning has occured the female will tend to the eggs while the male guards the area around the cave. The free swimming fry can be seen outside the cave after a week or so, although they will remain close to the cave for the intial period while they are aggressively guarded by the parents.","The fry are large enough to take brine shrimp nauplii from birth. Brood care is quite long-lived and they can remain with the parents until they are around 1\u2033 in length at which point they should be removed as the adults may turn on them. The adults may spawn again whilst the brood are still in the aquarium and will form a nuclear family with the older fry remaining in the parents\u2019 territory and tending to new broods of eggs."],"create_time":1426714182.50023}
