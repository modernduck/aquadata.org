The Tunga rises in the Western Ghats mountain range and is a tributary of the Tungabhadra River, itself a tributary of the Krishna.","The latter flows eastwards from Maharashtra state in the west of the country through Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. B. striata has been recorded at other localities within the Krishna drainage, including the Koyna and Panchganga rivers in Maharashtra."],"habitat":["In a survey of fish diversity in the Bhadra River (which joins the Tunga to form the Tungabhadra) it was recorded alongside numerous other species including Puntius chola,\u00a0Balitora mysorensis, and Mystus armatus.","Dry season water paramaters were temperature 69.8\u00b0F/21\u00b0C, pH 7.0, hardness ~ 2.5\u00b0.","The substrate was composed of bedrock, boulders, cobbles, gravel, sand and leaf litter in descending order of abundance, \u00a0maximum water depth was around 1.5 m and there was a degree of forest cover.","The study sampled at six sites but B. striata was found at only one of them, downstream of a dam which forms a reservoir on the river (Shahnawaz et al., 2009)."],"maintenance":["All botiids need a well-structured set-up although the actual choice of d\u00e9cor is more-or-less down to personal taste.","A natural-style arrangement could include a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of\u00a0sand\u00a0or\u00a0fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0with lots of smooth, water-worn rocks and pebbles plus driftwood roots and branches.","Lighting can be relatively subdued and plants able to grow in such conditions like\u00a0Microsorum pteropus\u00a0(Java fern),\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri\u00a0(\u2018Java\u2019 moss) or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be added if you wish. These have an added benefit as they can be attached to pieces of d\u00e9cor in such a way as to provide useful shade.","Otherwise be sure to provide plenty of cover as botiids\u00a0are inquisitive and seems to enjoy exploring their surroundings. Rocks, wood, flower pots and\u00a0aquarium\u00a0ornaments can be used in whichever combination to achieve the desired effect.","Bear in mind that they like to squeeze themselves into small gaps and crevices so items with sharp edges should be omitted, and any gaps or holes small enough for a fish to become trapped should be filled in with\u00a0aquarium-grade silicone sealant. A tightly-fitting cover is also essential as these loaches do jump at times.","Although botiids don\u2019t require turbulent conditions they do best when the water is well-oxygenated with a degree of flow, are intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water in order to thrive.","For these reasons they should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapt most readily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria. In terms of maintenance weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["While\u00a0Botia\u00a0spp. appear to be chiefly\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0they will also eat\u00a0vegetative\u00a0matter if available, often including soft-leaved\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants. The natural diet comprises aquatic molluscs, insects, worms, and other invertebrates.","They\u2019re largely unfussy feeders but must be offered a varied diet comprising quality dried products, live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, etc., plus fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach, or courgette.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients and bound with gelatin are also highly recommended.","Chopped earthworm can also provide a useful source of protein but should be used sparingly, and while most botiids also prey on\u00a0aquatic\u00a0snails though should never be considered the answer to an infestation since they\u2019re not\u00a0obligate\u00a0molluscivores.","Once settled into an\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they\u2019re bold feeders and often rise into midwater at meal times."],"behaviour":["Peaceful but don\u2019t keep it with much smaller fishes as they may be intimidated by its size and sometimes very active behaviour.","Slow-moving, long-finned\u00a0species\u00a0such as ornamental bettas, guppies and many cichlids should also be avoided as trailing fins can be nipped.","More suitable tankmates include peaceful, open water-dwelling cyprinids, while in larger tanks members of\u00a0Barilius,\u00a0Luciosoma,\u00a0Balantiocheilos\u00a0and\u00a0Barbonymus\u00a0become options.","In terms of other bottom-dwellers they will do well alongside most other\u00a0Botia\u00a0and in very large tanks,\u00a0Chromobotia macracanthus.","Some cobitid and nemacheilid loaches are also possibilities as are members of\u00a0Epalzeorhynchos,\u00a0Crossocheilus\u00a0and\u00a0Garra\u00a0and many catfishes. As always, thorough research prior to selecting a\u00a0community\u00a0of fishes is the best way to avoid problems.","Botia\u00a0spp. are\u00a0gregarious, form complex social hierarchies and should be maintained in groups of at least 5 or 6 specimens, preferably 10 or more.","When kept singly they can become withdrawn or aggressive towards similarly-shaped fishes, and if only a\u00a0pair\u00a0or trio are purchased the dominant individual may\u00a0stress the other(s) to the extent that they stop feeding.","That said they seemingly require regular contact with conspecifics, a fact exemplied by a number of behavioural rituals which have been recorded consistently in aquaria (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"reproduction":["Not known to have been bred in the hobby as with the majority of botiid loaches though some, including B. striata, are being produced on a commercial basis via the use of hormones.","Unfortunately this practice has been taken to a different level in recent years with a number of hybrids appearing on the market, even including an apparent cross between a form of B. histrionica and Chromobotia macracanthus."],"create_time":1426710687.30751}
