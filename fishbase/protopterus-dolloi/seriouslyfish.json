{"images":[],"distribution":["","Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Angola."],"habitat":["","It inhabits temporary floodplains (which are completely dry for part of the year), rivers, swamps, marshes, and backwaters."],"maintenance":["","Water movement in the aquarium should be kept to a minimum. This species is unfussy with regards to decor. Some cover can be provided in the form of roots, branches or large, smooth rocks, and any artificial lighting should be very dim. A sandy or muddy substrate is beneficial but not essential. What is most important is the the cover of the tank cannot be moved by the fish, and contains no gaps. These fish can and will escape given the slightest opportunity. A gap of around 6\u2033 should be left between the water surface and the cover to allow the fish access to the atmospheric air it needs to survive."],"diet":["","P. dolloi is omnivorous in nature, feeding on fish, invertebrates, amphibians and plant matter. It will adapt to a variety of foods in the aquarium. Offer prawn, mussel, lancefish, algae wafers and other vegetable matter. Larger specimens can be fed whole fish such as trout or sprats. This fish does not require food on a daily basis."],"behaviour":["","Best kept singly and alone. Some hobbyists do keep lungfish with other large species but this is very risky. Lungfish are unpredictable and can bite chunks out of other fish at will. Specimens that have been kept in a community situation for some time have been known to suddenly turn on their tankmates. It is also completely intolerant of congeners."],"reproduction":["","Spawning has not yet been achieved in captivity. In nature the fish construct nests into which the eggs are deposited. The nest is then protected by the male until they hatch."],"create_time":1426713446.05953}
