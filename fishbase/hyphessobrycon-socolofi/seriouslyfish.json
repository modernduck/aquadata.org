In the Negro system\u00a0it occurs in various affluents including the rios Branco, Padauari, and\u00a0Maraui\u00e1.","Type locality is \u2018Barcelos, 0\u00b058\u2019S, 62\u00b057\u2019W, Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil, 0\u00b058\u2019S, 62\u00b057\u2019W\u2019"],"habitat":["Mostly inhabits sluggish tributaries, side arms and forest lakes, and often associated with submerged woody structures such as roots, fallen branches, overhanging riparian vegetation or aquatic plants.","The water normally has a negligible dissolved mineral content, is poorly buffered and stained brown due to the gradual release of tannins and\u00a0organic\u00a0acids from decaying plant material.","The rio Padauari is a blackwater tributary of the rio Negro and H. socolofi has been collected close to the community of Tapera in deep, marginal zones with flowing water where the locals throw food scraps and wash clothes.","Syntopic fish species in this habitat included\u00a0Hemigrammus analis, Hemigrammus\u00a0ex gr. bellottii, Hyphessobrycon sp., Hyphessobrycon ex gr. bentosi, Paracheirodon axelrodi, Poecilocharax weitzmani, Crenuchus spilurus, two\u00a0Apistogramma spp., and Laetacara thayeri.","In the igarap\u00e9 \u00c1gua Boa it was collected from a ditch next to the main creek in a lowland v\u00e1rzea habitat with flowing water where it formed aggregations of 60-100 individuals.","Other fishes in this habitat were\u00a0Hemigrammus ex gr. bellottii, Hyphessobrycon sp., Hyphessobrycon ex gr. bentosi, Moenkhausia copei\u00a0and Moenkhhausia\u00a0ex gr. lepidura."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not especially critical although it tends to show better colouration when maintained in a well-furnished set-up with live plants and a dark\u00a0substrate.","A natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the biotope-style feel and with it the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves will aid in simulating natural\u00a0conditions.","Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under relatively dim lighting and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are recommended since they will grow under such conditions, and a few patches of floating vegetation may also prove effective.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit pristine environments it is intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water meaning weekly water changes\u00a0should be considered routine, and it should never be introduced to a biologically immature tank."],"diet":["This species is an opportunistic omnivore by nature.","The stomach contents of wild specimens from the rio Padauari were composed of fruit remains and aquatic insects with the former constituting 99% and latter 1% of all items consumed.","Stomachs of individuals from igarap\u00e9 \u00c1gua Boa contained 2.5 % ants (Hymenoptera (Formicidae), 20% terrestrial insects\u00a0 (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae and Diptera: Chironomidae), 53.3% fruit remains, 19.5% fish scales and 4 % elmid beetles.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0alongside good quality dried flakes and granules, at least some of which should include additional plant or algal content.","Submerged pieces of fresh fruit will also be grazed but should only be left in the aquarium for a few hours."],"behaviour":["Generally peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium, although adult males are territorial to an extent and this behaviour may sometimes extend to similarly-shaped species.","It is perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you will be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle.","The interaction between rival males is fascinating to watch and they will display their best colours when competing for female attention or hierarchical position."],"reproduction":"Egg scatterer exhibiting no parental care.","create_time":1426712216.19054}
