The Tunga is part of the Upper Krishna River drainage and arises from a hill known as Varaha Parvata\u00a0in the Western Ghats mountain range.","It\u00a0flows northeastwards, through the districts of Chikkamagaluru and Shimoga, before emptying into the Bhadra River\u00a0from which point it\u2019s known as\u00a0the Tungabhadra until it enters the Krishna in Andhra Pradesh state.","A 2008 fish diversity survey of the Bhadra failed to record G. bicornuta at any locality other than its confluence with the Tunga, suggesting this might represent the lower limit of its range. It may occur in other parts of the Krishna basin but we\u2019ve been unable to find any definitive references.","Neither origin nor accuracy of reported occurences in Kolhapur District, Maharashtra state van be confirmed, either, and it\u2019s possibly endemic to the Tunga."],"habitat":["Southern India is heavily affected by the summer monsoons meaning that many, possibly all, of the species\u2019 habitats are subjected to subject to seasonal variations in flow/partial drying. The Tunga winds its course through a series of valleys and hills covered by semi-deciduous forest or bamboo, and unlike the heavily-polluted Tungabhadra is noted for the purity of its water.","Korkanhalla stream is the type locality of\u00a0Psilorhynchus tenura\u00a0Arunachalam and Muralidharan, 2008, and an upper tributary of the Tunga flowing through Khudremukh National Park at around 650 m AMSL. It has a mixed gravel/cobble susbstrate and\u00a0G. bicornuta was also recorded there with sympatric species including\u00a0Parambassis ranga, Garra mullya,\u00a0Opsarius\u00a0canarensis, Osteochilichthys nashii, Dawkinsia arulius, Puntius sahyadriensis (though the stream is outside the distribution range normally quoted for this species), Rasbora daniconius, Salmophasia boopis, Botia striata, Balitora mysorensis, Schistura semiarmata, Glyptothorax madraspatanum and Mystus keletius."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep in a well-maintained set-up, but a display arranged\u00a0to resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river,\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized, water-worn rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0and perhaps some small boulders, is highly recommended. This can be further furnished with driftwood roots or branches and hardy\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp., which can be grown attached to items of d\u00e9cor.","Most importantly, the water must be clean and well-oxygenated with turnover preferably\u00a0in excess of 10 times per hour; additional powerheads and airstones can be employed to achieve the desired flow and\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0if necessary. Bright lighting will promote development\u00a0of\u00a0biofilm\u00a0on solid surfaces, upon which the fish will\u00a0graze.","Since it needs stable water conditions and grazes\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass."],"diet":["Although it will\u00a0graze\u00a0algae\u00a0if available this\u00a0species\u00a0is not an exclusive\u00a0herbivore. Offer meaty foods such as live or frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, chopped prawn, etc., along with good quality, sinking dried products, at least some of which should contain a significant proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach or courgette can be offered occasionally and home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, are also proven to work well."],"behaviour":["Can be territorial at times, especially when food is added to the aquarium, and will often actively pursue other fishes straying into the vicinity. This behaviour tends to vary even within individuals, so it may form temporary territories based on food availability in nature.","At any rate this means the most suitable tankmates are active, peaceful\u00a0cyprinids\u00a0since they are normally agile enough to avoid such attacks. Slow-moving or long-finned species should be omitted in the majority of circumstances.","In terms of bottom-dwellers, similarly-shaped fishes such as other Garra, Crossocheilus or Epalzeorhynchos are likely to prove incompatible in all but the largest set-ups, though more robust members of Botia, Sinibotia, and Yasuhikotakia should also work.\u00a0Species from the families Balitoridae and Nemacheildae are generally ignored but, as always when selecting a fish community, proper research is essential.","A set-up based around fish from the Western Ghats would also make an interesting project with possibilities\u00a0including Dawksinia arulius, D. filamentosus, D. tambraparniei,\u00a0Opsarius\u00a0bakeri, O. canarensis, Devario\u00a0malabaricus, Schistura denisonii, Nemachilichthys shimogensis,\u00a0and Mesonoemacheilus triangularis.","It is not particularly tolerant of conspecifics but normally exists in loose aggregations in the wild. If kept singly it tends to behave more aggressively with similarly-shaped fishes so the purchase of at least 3-4 individuals is recommended.","Such a group will develop a noticeable pecking order between themselves but tankmates are more likely to be left alone. What appear to be hierarchical disputes will sometimes occur and involve charging, flaring of fins and an overall paling of the body colouration."],"reproduction":["The reproductive biology of Garra spp. is poorly-studied and captive breeding of any species a rare occurrence. A 2005 study of G. gotyla\u00a0in Nepal concluded that the fish spawn throughout the monsoon season and appear migratory to some extent, i.e, they swim upstream before depositing their eggs.","G. rufa is produced in commercial quantities for health spas without the use of hormones and G. flavatra and G. ceylonensis have both been bred using natural methods.","The latter is an endangered Sri Lankan endemic and was the subject of a 2005 study designed to determine an appropriate means of artificial reproduction for conservation purposes. The adults were conditioned in groups before reverse trios consisting of a single female and two males were isolated in smaller (60 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm) tanks.","Spawning was initiated by switching off the aeration and the adults removed once eggs were spotted. The only courtship behaviour observed was intense chasing and the spawning tanks had to be covered in order to prevent the fish jumping out.","Eggs hatched in 36-48 hours at 26-28\u00b0C and the yolk sac was absorbed within 4 days. The larvae were found not to possess an adhesive disc and initially swam freely in the water column. Disc development took between 60-64 days and once fully-formed the fry began to assume a more benthic lifestyle.","During the free- swimming stage the researchers found that they preferred to feed from the substrate and favoured formulated foods over live Artemia nauplii or microworm.","G. flavatra is currently being bred for the aquatic trade. In this case adult pairs are separated into smaller tanks containing highly-oxygenated, running water. The fry are first fed an egg yolk suspension until big enough to handle Artemia nauplii."],"create_time":1426711758.66741}
