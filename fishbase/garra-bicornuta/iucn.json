The number of locations estimated for this species is 6-10 and the population is severely fragmented. Although this fish is found in at least one protected site at Kudremukh National Park,  the areas where it generally occurs are threatened by deforestation, urbanization and urban and  industrial pollution. Furthermore, this species is very rare. If further research finds that its AOO is actually less than the inferred AOO used for this assessment, then a reassessment may result in this species being moved into a threatened category.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N.","evaluator":"Rema Devi, K.R., Gopalakrishnan, A., Arunachalam, M., Shrikant, J., Johnson, J.A., Rahul, K. & Molur, S."}]
