Its population has been much reduced (by more than 90%) over the last decade (C. Vidthayanon, pers. comm.), as a result of overfishing and habitat degradation. The species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered. This fish is also likely to be impacted in the future by development of mainstream dams, which will further limit its breeding success.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Ng, H.H., Rainboth, W., Kottelat, M., Kullander, S.O., Parenti, L. & Allen, D.J."}]
