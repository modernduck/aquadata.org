an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases though a degree of flow is acceptable."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","In a community it\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","It\u2019s very much a\u00a0gregarious\u00a0animal so buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour.","Unlike some relatives rival males rarely spar or do each other harm in any way."],"reproduction":"Not thought to have been bred in captivity, with earlier reports all appearing to pertain to the congener N. eques which is known to deposit eggs on the underside of plant leaves and similar structures.","create_time":1426712863.09778}
