We suggest a sandy substrate, with smooth rocks and driftwood pieces for decoration. Leave plenty of open space for swimming. You can plant the aquarium if you wish but be prepared for bite marks to appear in the leaves if the puffer spots any morsels of food on them."],"diet":["","T. mbu is a molluscivore in nature, and in the aquarium relishes all kinds of shellfish, as well as worms and other live and frozen foods. It should be fed snails and unshelled shellfish (such as crab legs, mussels etc.) regularly, in order to maintain its sharp teeth. As with other puffers, these grow continuously and become a problem for the fish if they are not kept ground down."],"behaviour":["","A generally aggressive and intolerant species that really should be kept alone. Its beak-like mouth can easily bite chunks from other fish, or in extreme cases rip them to pieces. However, some specimens are less aggressive than others and it is down to the individual fish as to how it will react to tankmates. If you decide to take the risk, you will need a huge tank and tankmates that swim too quickly for the puffer to catch them easily. \nIt is also very aggressive towards conspecifics and should never be kept in groups."],"reproduction":["","Breeding has not occured in aquaria. A truly enormous volume of water would be required for any serious breeding attempt."],"create_time":1426714034.90144}
