Individual females may also be targeted so it\u2019s best to stock several per male.","In a community it can be kept alongside other Victorian species but take care not to mix populations and avoid keeping it with other Pundamilia spp.","It also makes a suitable companion for many mbuna from Lake Malawi, but be sure to research your choices properly prior to purchase."],"reproduction":["Maternal mouthbrooder. Ideally it should be bred spawned in a species tank using a single male and at least 3 females, although it will often spawn in the community aquarium.","Perhaps the easiest way to obtain a breeding group is to begin with a batch of young fish. Once sexually mature males will select a\u00a0spawning site which is defended against other males, and display to passing females to mate with him.","A receptive female will approach the spawning site and deposit a few eggs, immediately taking them into her mouth as she goes.","The male has coloured\u00a0spots on his anal-fin which resemble eggs and the female is also attracted to these. When she tries to add them to the clutch\u00a0in her mouth, the male releases milt and the eggs are fertilised. The cycle is then repeated until the female is spent of eggs.","The female will carry the eggs for around 3 weeks before releasing free-swimming fry which can be offered Artemia\u00a0nauplii, microworm, powdered dry foods\u00a0and suchlike immediately."],"create_time":1426713550.38485}
