{"images":[],"distribution":"Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo.","habitat":"Most often found in large rivers and lakes, including Tanganyika.","maintenance":"There is no need for any decor except perhaps a sandy base due to the speed and power of these fish. Water should be of the highest quality and well-oxygenated. It is a very active swimmer and therefore requires an absolutely enormous aquarium.","diet":"It is a piscivore by nature and many sources state that it will only feed on live fish. This is not true and it can be weaned onto whitebait and other dead foods fairly easily.","behaviour":"Should be kept alone, although juvenile fish do shoal. There are reports of it being kept with Loricariids, cichlids etc. but these are usually young fish being kept with larger tankmates. Anything smaller than the tiger fish may be ripped to pieces without prior warning.","reproduction":"Not achieved in aquaria.","create_time":1426712090.16007}
