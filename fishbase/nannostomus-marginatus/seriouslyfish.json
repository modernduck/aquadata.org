locality is \u2018Maduni Creek, Guyana\u2019,\u00a0and this species is widely-distributed throughout Guyana and Suriname, plus the middle-to-lower Amazon basin east of the Andes mountains in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil.","Records thus exist from various major river systems including the Rupununi, Takutu,\u00a0Essequibo and Demerara in Guyana, the Nickerie and \u00a0Courantyne/Corantijn in Suriname,\u00a0In\u00edrida and Caquet\u00e1 in Colombia, the Ucayali, Javari, Ampiyacu, and Putumayo in Peru, the Napo in Ecuador and Peru, Juru\u00e1 in Brazil, and throughout most major left-bank tributaries of the Amazon in Brazil, including the Japur\u00e1, Negro, Branco, and Trombetas.","Records from the upper R\u00edo Orinoco in Venezuela also exist but may require confirmation.","There also exist a number of minor differences in colour pattern between populations.","For example some Peruvian forms have yellow pigmentation on the body and fins, and those from Guyana and Suriname possess a short red stripe on vertical scale rows 6-9, above the central dark stripe on the body.","Rio Negro forms have a similar red stripe but overlapping the central dark stripe and extending along most of the flank, while a form from Colombia has an elongate red stripe which is broken in two beneath the dorsal-fin.","One form from Peru was described as a subspecies, N. m. picturatus, by Hoedeman (1954) but is currently considered synonymous with N. marginatus.","It has a distinctive red blotch on the caudal-fin base, between the primary and secondary dark lateral stripes.","This variability has yet to be studied in depth."],"habitat":["Inhabits sluggish tributaries, small rivers and swampy areas, particularly in areas with dense growth of aquatic vegetation or submerged woody structures and leaf litter.","It\u2019s often found in areas of flooded forest and floodplain lakes in blackwater regions.","Typical habitats contain shallow, near still water with very little detectable hardness, low conductivity, and a pH of 4.0-6.0, with other fishes comprising small characids, other lebiasinids, and dwarf cichlids of the genus Apistogramma.","La Arenosa is a small stream in Amazonas department, southern Colombia flowing\u00a0down from terra firme forest into a floodplain of the Amazon mainstream.","It varies from 2-5 m in width and up to 2 m in depth and contains slowly-moving, clear blackwater the majority of the time, temporarily increasing in depth and flow rate after storms.","PH ranges from 5.51-6.01, conductivity 18-38 \u00b5S/cm, dissolved oxygen 70%, and an average water temperature of 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F.","N. marginatus was found to be a permanent resident of the stream in a study conducted over a period of one year, with symaptric species includingthe congener N. trifasciatus plus\u00a0Axelrodia stigmatias, Hemigrammus analis, H. bellottii, H. ocellifer, H. schmardae, H. copelandi, Moenkhausia comma, M. sanctafilomenae, Tyttocharax cochui, Tetragonopterus argenteus, Characidium zebra, Crenuchus spilurus, Hoplias malabaricus, Carnegiella strigata, Copella nattereri, Corydoras semiaquilis, Megalechis thoracata, Limatulichthys griseus, Farlowella amazona, Eigenmannia virescens, Aequidens diadema, Apistogramma bitaeniata, Satanoperca sp., \u00a0Cichla monoculus, Crenicichla saxatilis, and Monocirrhus polyacanthus."],"maintenance":["Should ideally be kept in a heavily-planted\u00a0set-up, preferably with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The broken lines of sight that exist in such a display allow it to display natural behaviour as well as helping to reduce skittishness.","Floating plants are a useful addition as are driftwood branches and dried leaf litter, the latter in particular driving\u00a0establishment of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","Such microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","Use gentle filtration; an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases.","This species requires stable water conditions and should never be added to an immature aquarium."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","It\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","It\u2019s very much a\u00a0gregarious\u00a0animal so buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour.","Unlike some relatives rival males rarely spar or do each other harm in any way."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved in aquaria, albeit rarely,\u00a0and in a densely-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of\u00a0fry\u00a0a slightly more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more smaller containers should also be set up and filled with aged water.","Fill much\u00a0of the available space with fine wool mops,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or other fine-leaved aquatic plant.","Neither lighting nor filtration is necessary although you can install a small air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0if you prefer.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned one or more\u00a0pairs can then be introduced to each container, though it\u2019s worth noting that the more individuals involved the greater the risk of\u00a0egg\u00a0predation.","The adults can be removed after 2-3 days and the first fry should be visible a day or two later.","If using mops, an alternative method is to check them on a daily basis, removing and replacing them as you find eggs and hatching the fry elsewhere.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712845.20719}
