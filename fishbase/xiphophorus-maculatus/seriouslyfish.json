They exhibit none of the aggression of some swordtails and mollies, and even males tolerate one another."],"reproduction":["","Very easy. Will breed in the community tank. To be honest breeding this species is more of a case of \u2018when\u2019 rather then \u2018how\u2019. If you\u2019re not interested inbreeding them, buy only male fish. Otherwise breeding is much the same as for many other livebearers. We recommend that several females should be kept to every male in order to dissipate vigorous harassment by males. Areas of dense planting will also help. Gestation takes around 4-6 weeks and large broods of up to 80 fry are not uncommon. The adult fish will not eat their young but the best method of raising them is still to remove the gravid female to a separate tank and allow her to give birth there before returning her to the main aquarium. The use of breeding nets or traps is not recommended as their small size is not suitable for raising fry. The fry are quite large and will accept brine shrimp nauplii or powdered flake from birth. They grow very quickly if fed 2-3 times per day."],"create_time":1426714251.71366}
