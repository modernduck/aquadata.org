A sandy substrate is best. This species does not damage vegetation so plants can be used but are not essential, likewise driftwood pieces. Select hard water-tolerant species such as Anubias or Vallisneria."],"diet":["","Will accept most foods offered but live and frozen varieties should form the bulk of the diet."],"behaviour":["","The species is quite shy by nature, and aggressive or boisterous tankmates such as Mbuna should be avoided. Good choices include Julidochromis, Neolamprologus, Cyprichromis and Tanganyikan Synodontis catfish. It\u2019s important to keep a group of at least eight of these, as it\u2019s gregarious by nature and may become withdrawn without the security of conspecifics."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in aquaria although it is likely possible. Little information about its natural spawning behaviour exists. It\u2019s known to be a polygamous maternal mouthbrooder that spawns in depressions in the substrate which are dug by the male. If you want to breed this fish using a similar approach as with other substrate-spawning Malawi cichlids is probably a good place to start."],"create_time":1426711625.3152}
