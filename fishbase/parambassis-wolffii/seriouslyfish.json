Provide cover by planting some areas of the tank densely, along with some floating vegetation. Rocks and driftwood can also be used. This is a freshwater species and does not require the addition of salt to its tank."],"diet":["","This species is more predatory than other commonly imported Parambassis species. Although it will usually accept dried foods, these should not form the basis of the diet. Offer live foods such as small earthworms, bloodworm etc. Frozen prawns, bloodworm and brine shrimp should also be provided."],"behaviour":["","P. wolffii is predatory by nature and any small tankmates will be eaten. It is best kept with larger species such as gouramis, medium-sized barbs, rainbowfish etc. It is a shoaling species and does best when kept in a group of at least 6."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in captivity, although the process is probably similar to that of P. ranga."],"create_time":1426713162.30509}
