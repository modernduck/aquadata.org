Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs are normally deposited on the aquarium glass, but it\u2019s recommended to provide alternatives in the form of fine-leaved vegetation or fine spawning mops.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger.","The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated. Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare-bottomed arrangement."],"create_time":1426711099.76909}
