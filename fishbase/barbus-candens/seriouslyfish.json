Its principal range appears to extend between the town of Lisala and city of Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville) to the north of the main river channel. Specific localities include a number of little known streams and rivers including the Lomboma, Loweo, Lubilaye, Bole, Lusambila, Isalowe, Boonde, Akuku I, Yoli, Ngene-Ngene and Botchangulu in the Yangambi area alone.","It\u2019s also been recorded close to the settlements of Ibembo on the Itimbiri River and Buta to the northeast, at Mondimbi just south of the main Congo River near Bumba, Mongonde west of Lisala, Bengamisa and the Masendula River north of Kisangami. Other populations have been found further south in the Lilanda River (Yangole area) and close to Ikela. Fish from the different localities are likely to vary in colour and patterning to some extent and if collection details are known they should always be labelled as such in order to preserve bloodlines and maintain accuracy.","Further records also exist but may represent cases of mistaken identity because localities such as the Kasai River, Djamba, Bena Tshadi, Lodja and The Republic of the Congo (!) are geographically distant from the rest of the species\u2018 range."],"habitat":"Inhabits typical slow-moving, shallow, shady rainforest streams and swamps with dense marginal vegetation. The water is stained brown due to the release of tannins and other chemicals released by decomposing plant matter and the substrate scattered with fallen leaves, twigs and branches. Such environments characteristically contain very soft (negligible hardness), acidic, cool water and are often dimly-lit due to the rainforest canopy above.","maintenance":["This species can be maintained quite successfully in a well-planted tank with soft water but to see it at its best a biotope-style set-up is recommended. A soft, sandy substrate is probably the best choice to which can be added a few driftwood roots and branches, placed in such a way that plenty of shady spots are formed. If you can\u2019t find driftwood of the desired shape common beech or oak is safe to use if thoroughly dried and stripped of bark.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable; we like to use a mixture of all three) would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering even more cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These tiny creatures can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are thought to be beneficial for blackwater fish species such as this. Certainly \u2018B.\u2018 candens is known to display much more intense colouration in tannin-stained water. Leaves can be left in the tank to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This species will do best under fairly dim lighting. You could add some African plants that can survive under such conditions such as Anubias species or if geography is not an issue Microsorum pteropus, Taxiphyllum barbieri or perhaps some potted Cryptocorynes.","A few patches of floating vegetation would be really useful to diffuse the light entering the tank too. As the species hails from sluggish waters filtration should not be too strong. An air-powered sponge filter set to turn over slowly is adequate or if using a power filter adjust it to a low flow setting. Do not add this fish to a biologically immature tank as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry."],"diet":"In the aquarium it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should not be fed these exclusively. Daily meals of small live and frozen foods such as Daphnia, Artemia and suchlike will result in the best colouration and encourage the fish to come into breeding condition.","behaviour":["\u2018B.\u2018 candens is not really suitable for most community\u00a0aquaria as it has something of a shy, retiring nature and may be intimidated or outcompeted for food by larger/more boisterous tankmates. Choose similarly-sized, peaceful African species such as \u2018B.\u2018 jae, Aplocheilichthys\u00a0spp., Ladigesia roloffi or Lepidarchus adonis. We suspect it will also do ok with many small South American characins, Otocinclus or smaller\u00a0Corydoras catfish and other cyprinids like Trigonostigma or Boraras species.","Although\u00a0gregarious by nature it is a shoaling rather than schooling species which develops a distinct pecking order between males. It should ideally be maintained in a group of 8 or more but the tank must be of a sufficient size which will allow weaker individuals some respite from dominant conspecifics and decorated in such a way that many broken lines of sight are provided. Conversely if kept singly, in a very small group or in cramped conditions it can become withdrawn and subdominant fish may be bullied incessantly."],"reproduction":["American aquarist Ted Judy has spawned this species and kindly provided some of the following information:","Like many small cyprinids this species is an egg-scattering, continuous spawner that exhibits zero parental care. That is to say when in good condition and in the presence of both males and females relatively small numbers of eggs will be laid daily. In a properly-furnished aquarium as described above it is therefore possible that small numbers of fry may start to appear without human intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of fry a slightly more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more small, say 12\u2033 x 8\u2033 x 8\u2033/30cm x 20cm x 20cm/12.5 litre, containers should also be set up. Water chemistry parameters ought to be within the values suggested above. Ted bred the fish at a temperature of 24\u00b0C/75\u00b0F.","Decor can be very simple; a couple of sinking spawning mops or good-sized clumps of Java moss will give the fish somewhere to deposit their eggs and a handful or two of real peat fibre will help to create the correct water conditions.","If you prefer to keep the base of the tank bare for maintenance purposes a small air-powered box filter filled with peat and set to turn over slowly is a good alternative, otherwise filtration is not absolutely necessary. The addition of a few oak, beech or Ketapang almond leaves is also a good idea.","A single pair of well-conditioned adult fish should then be introduced to each container. It is wise to make the transfer slowly in order to avoid excessive levels of stress but if conditions are to their liking they should begin to spawn the next day. Whether this species eats its eggs or not is unclear although it certainly appears not to actively hunt for them as is the case with many small cyprinids.","Ted observed that when the fish are spawned in a group the non-spawning individuals would eat eggs of the breeders however. Once spawning has commenced it should continue sporadically on a daily basis and it is at this point that the spawning mops/plants become doubly effective as they offer refuge for the female when she needs to escape the attentions of the frequently over-zealous male.","The pair(s) can be left in situ to spawn until the first free-swimming fry are noticed. This should be within 10-12 days and at this point the adults are best removed. The tiny young will survive on their yolk sacs for around 2-3 more days after which they should be large enough to accept microworm as a first food and later Artemia nauplii.","As the days pass additional fry should start to appear from later spawning events. It\u2019s best to wait a week or two before starting to perform small water changes in order to avoid unduly shocking the young fish."],"create_time":1426710475.1908}
