It is readily recognizable as a catfish with four pairs of barbels (whiskers) and fleshy, papillated lips. The teeth are villiform (small and bristle-like), occurring in patches on the jaw and palate (Jayaram, 1981). The eyes are small. The pectoral spines are large and robust and finely serrate along the margins. There is no dorsal spine. The dorsal fin is continuous and extends along the back two-thirds of the length of the body. The dorsal, caudal, and anal fins together form a near-continuous margin; the caudal fin is rounded and not eel-like though it is occasionally fused with the other fins (Talwar and Jhingran 1991). The complete spine/ray count is: Dorsal = 62-72; Anal = 45-58; Pectoral = I + 8-11 (Sen 1985).Color is drab but variable among individuals: olive to dark brown or purple to black on the dorsal surface; pale to white on the ventral surface; and blue-green on the sides. The fins are grey-green and small white specks are present on the back half of the body (Page and Burr 1991). An albino variant occurs naturally and has been commercialized for the aquarium hobby trade.","agents":[{"full_name":"J.

C. batrachus will outcompete or directly consume several co-occurring native species.Invasion History: Walking catfish are native to southeastern Asia, and the natural range of the species includes Sri Lanka, eastern India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Philippines, Borneo, Java, and Thailand (Axelrod et al. 1971, Jayaram 1981 Sen 1985, Talwar and Jhingran 1991). They were originally imported to the U.S. in the 1960s as an aquarium industry candidate species. Unlike many other accidental introductions to the state of Florida, the release of C. batrachus is partly documented. The initial escape of this species, in the mid-1960s, was either from a Broward County, Florida fish farm or from a truck transporting broodstock. The animals that escaped were derived from stock originally imported from Thailand (Courtenay et al. 1974, Courtenay et al. 1984).A second, independent introduction in 1967-1968 has been implicated in the establishment of a Hillsborough County C. batrachus population (Courtenay et al. 1974, Courtenay 1978). In this case, animals were reportedly intentionally released by fish farmers after the state banned the possession of walking catfish.Since these initial release events, walking catfish have rapidly expanded their range within Florida. A combination of traits such as high fecundity, the ability to cross land barriers to move between isolated water bodies, and the ability to avoid desiccation during dry seasons make this fish a capable pioneering invader. The ability of this species to utilize networks of man-made drainage canals has further facilitated its spread in Florida and elsewhere (Nico 2005).Populations of walking catfish became established in Florida within just a couple years of the initial introduction; by 1968 the species was already established in three counties (Courtenay et al. 1984). Within a decade of initial establishment, the Florida range of walking catfish would expand to nearly 20 counties, and by 1984 the range included all counties within the IRL watershed except Volusia. Potential to Compete With Natives: Early on, the invasive potential of C. batrachus was recognized, and Lachner (1970) suggested that the walking catfish Florida introduction was at that time potentially the most harmful introduction to date in the country. That author harvested as much as 3,000 lbs of walking catfish per acre from isolated Florida small ponds.The walking catfish is a threat to the native fish populations in Florida and the broader Gulf of Mexico region. The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission calls it \"one of the most notorious and harmful non-indigenous species\" in the ecosystem.The impacts from this opportunist feeder are probably most pronounced in small, isolated wetland ponds where walking catfish quickly consume or outcompete other resident populations to become the dominant species in the pond (Shafland 1996). Resident centrarchids (freshwater sunfish) and native catfish species appear particularly susceptible to impacts from this invader.Baber and Babbitt (2003) note that C. batrachus can also negatively impact native amphibian populations by preying on tadpoles. The ability of walking catfish to exploit isolated, ephemeral water bodies allows them to access tadpole prey stocks that other fish cannot reach. Possible Economic Consequences of Invasion: The actual ecological and economic impact of C. batrachus introduction in Florida is still largely unknown. One specific example of an observed economic impacts is the cost associated with barrier fences. Florida fish farmers have had to install such fences to keep walking catfish out of their ponds (Courtenay and Stauffer 1990, Nico 2005).Although they are reared as a food crop within much of their native range, particularly in India (Sen, 1985), walking catfish are not at this time valued as a food or sport fish in FloridaThe walking catfish has been nominated as among 100 of the \"World's Worst Invaders\" by the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG).","agents":[{"full_name":"J.
