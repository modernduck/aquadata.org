to be endemic to the lower Kapuas river basin in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan (Kalimantan Barat), Borneo.","Type locality is given as \u2018Sanggau area, Kapuas basin, Kalimantan Barat, Borneo\u2019 although the fish themselves were from the aquarium trade.","Separate populations were collected from the Sekayan and Melawi rivers (both Kapuas tributaries) close to the townships of Sanggau and Nanga Pinoh, respectively."],"habitat":["Inhabits the upper reaches of clear, flowing forest hill streams where it can be found in quieter marginal zones and still pools which typically contain a mixture of leaf litter, gravel\u00a0and\u00a0rocks.","At some localities the water is stained weakly brown with humic acids and other chemicals released by decaying organic material.","The dense canopy of branches above allows very little light to penetrate the water surface and marginal vegetation also tends to grow thickly in the areas where the fish are found."],"maintenance":["Can be maintained in a fully-decorated aquarium although many breeders prefer not to use a substrate for ease of maintenance.","Driftwood roots and branches can be used and placed such a way that a few shady spots are formed while clay plant pots or lengths of piping can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of dried leaf litter further emphasises the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry and the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial for fishes from blackwater environments.","There is no need to use natural peat, however, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","Like others in the genus this species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting.","You could add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum or Cryptocoryne spp., and a few patches of floating vegetation would be useful as well.","This species requires acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","As it naturally inhabits sluggish waters filtration should not be too strong, with an air-powered sponge filter set to turn over gently adequate.","Keep the tank well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all Betta spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an excellent jumper."],"diet":["Preys on insects and other invertebrates in nature with very small fish perhaps being taken as well.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will normally accept dried foods once they are recognised as edible but like all fish does best when offered a varied diet.","In this case regular meals of live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0will ensure the development of the best colours and condition.","Small insects such as crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use although it\u2019s best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish.","Take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp.\u00a0seem particularly prone to obesity."],"behaviour":["Not a recommended choice for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon.","It\u2019s care requirements and disposition mean it is best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate it.","Some small cyprinids\u00a0are suitable and it could even be maintained alongside other anabantoids given sufficient space, but proper research is essential.","Provided the\u00a0tank\u00a0contains plenty of hiding places and broken lines of sight there\u2019s no reason why a group can\u2019t be maintained together, although a little squabbling is inevitable.","Exceptions may occur if a\u00a0pair\u00a0is\u00a0spawning\u00a0when females in particular can be aggressive."],"reproduction":["Paternal mouthbrooder. Organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","A single\u00a0pair\u00a0or group of fish can be used but\u00a0be aware that each male is capable of holding up to 60\u00a0fry\u00a0so considerable space will be needed should you wish to raise them all.","The female plays the more active role in initiating\u00a0courtship\u00a0and defending the area against intruders.","Eggs and milt are released during an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of anabantoids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female.","Several \u2018practice\u2019 embraces may be required before any eggs are released.","Once spawning commences eggs are laid in small batches and picked up in the mouth of the female before being spat out into the water for the male to catch.","Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth the cycle is repeated untill the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0which can take some time.","The incubation period is 12-17 days at which point the male will begin to release fully-formed, free-swimming\u00a0fry.","While some breeders have never had a problem with this\u00a0species\u00a0eating its own young others have lost entire broods\u00a0through predation, but many remove the female (plus any other fishes present) a few days after\u00a0spawning.","This needs to be done as carefully as possible in order to avoid disturbing the male as he may swallow or release the\u00a0brood\u00a0prematurely if stressed.","Once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are swimming and foraging freely the male can also be removed if you wish.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable."],"create_time":1426710563.59698}
