The species was found to be abundant when collected in the northern area, and at present the species is assessed as Least Concern in the absence of significant threats. The condition of Indawgyi Lake needs to be monitored for potential impacts from a growing human population around its margins.","assessor":"Britz, R.","evaluator":"Datta, N.C., Dey, S.C., Jha, B.R. & Allen, D.J."}]
