Some of them are almost certain to be described as distinct species in the future."],"habitat":["Unsuprisingly given its huge natural range, the species has been collected from a range of habitat-types. In Penang it\u2019s been collected from shallow (10 \u2013 80cm deep) stagnant/stiller parts of clearwater hill streams and foothills.","The substrate is most often sandy with little to no aquatic vegetation and the fish can be found among submerged leaf litter or sheltering under overhanging marginal vegetation/exposed tree roots. In Johor the species is also know to inhabit flowing streams, some of which contain large quantities of submerged vegetation.","Other thriving populations have been discovered in much stiller forest swamps and associated streams. These environments are usually shaded from the sun, the dense canopy of branches above meaning very little light penetrates the water surface.","Marginal vegetation also tends to grow thickly. The water itself is typically stained with humic acids and other chemicals released by decaying organic material and is usually acidic with negligible hardness.","Much of its natural range has been heavily-modified, with conversion of the original forest to oil palm plantations particularly common, and it can also be found within these cultivated areas in ditches and channels."],"maintenance":["Can be maintained in a fully-decorated\u00a0aquarium\u00a0although many\u00a0breeders prefer not to use a substrate for ease of maintenance. Driftwood roots and branches can be used and placed such a way that a few shady spots are formed.","If you can\u2019t find driftwood of the desired shape common beech or oak is safe to use if thoroughly dried and stripped of bark. Clay plant pots or lengths of piping can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of dried leaf litter, with beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves all suitable, can further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry\u00a0and the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial.","Like others in the\u00a0genus\u00a0this\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting. You could add aquatic plant\u00a0species\u00a0that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum pteropus,\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri\u00a0or perhaps some potted\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., and a few patches of floating vegetation would be useful to diffuse the light entering the\u00a0tank.","Filtration need not be too strong, with an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0set to turn over gently adequate. Keep the\u00a0tank\u00a0well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an\u00a0excellent jumper."],"diet":["Likely to prey on insects and other small invertebrates/zooplankton\u00a0in nature.\u00a0Captive fish\u00a0will normally accept dried products once they\u2019re recognised as edible, but should be offered plenty of small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0regularly to ensure development of optimal colour and condition.","Small insects such as crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use; it\u2019s best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish.\u00a0Take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. seem particularly prone to obesity."],"behaviour":["Not recommended for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon. It\u2019s requirements and disposition mean it\u2019s best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate and outcompete it. Some small cyprinids and loaches that inhabit similar environments in nature are compatible.","It can be maintained in a pair or group and will display some interesting behavioural interactions under the latter circumstances."],"reproduction":["Paternal mouthbrooder. Ideally organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes, unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","Following a protracted courtship, eggs and milt are released during an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female. Several \u2018dummy\u2019 embraces may be required before spawning commences.","Fertilised eggs are caught on the anal fin of the male then picked up in the mouth of the female before being spat out into the water for the male to catch. Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth the cycle is repeated untill the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0which can take some time.","A brooding male may swallow or release the\u00a0eggs\u00a0prematurely if stressed or inexperienced, so it\u2019s preferable to leave the female and any other fishes\u00a0in situ.","The incubation period is 9-16 days at the end of which the male will begin to release fully-formed, free-swimming\u00a0fry.\u00a0At this point they can be removed or left to grow alongside the parents, though some may be lost to predation under the latter circumstances.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones."],"create_time":1426710612.44397}
