{"images":{"src":"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Hoplerythrinus-unitaeniatus-288x192.jpg"},"distribution":["","Widespread throughout much of South America, it\u2019s found in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. Populations have also been recorded in Panama and Trinidad and Tobago."],"habitat":["","Small tributaries, swamps, marshes, pools, ditches and the margins of forest lakes. It\u2019s often found in very shallow water or lurkng among surface vegetation."],"maintenance":["","Ideally, keep it in a heavily planted tank with plenty of floating vegetation, which will allow it to exhibit its natural behaviour. In a brightly lit or sparsely decorated tank, it tends to spend a lot of its time hidden away. It can be kept in unplanted tanks, but at the very least provide lots of hiding places and refuges. Make sure the cover is very tightly fitting as it can and will escape if given the opportunity."],"diet":["","Feeds on both insects and fish in nature. In the aquarium, its diet should consist of meaty fare such as earthworms, prawns, mussels and white fish such as lancefish. It usually refuses dried foods, although some specimens have been known to accept them over time. Many hobbyists feed predatory species such as this on large quantities of live \u2018feeder\u2019 fish, but there is no real benefit to this, and there is always the risk of introducing disease or parasites when feeding live fish."],"behaviour":["","Despite its fearsome appearance, it can be combined with other similarly-sized species in a large tank. In order to see it act naturally, though, it\u2019s much better off when kept alone as a single specimen. Smaller fish will be eaten, and it\u2019s very intolerant of conspecifics, often fighting with them to the death."],"reproduction":["","It\u2019s not been bred in the hobby."],"create_time":1426712062.80233}
