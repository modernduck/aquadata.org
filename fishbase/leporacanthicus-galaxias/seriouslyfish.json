Provide hiding places and shade with some big chunks of driftwood and smooth rocks. Dim lighting is also beneficial and it\u2019s imperative that the water is highly oxygenated, preferably with a good amount of movement. Consider the use of powerheads or large airstones to produce the desired effect. An efficient filter is needed to deal with the large amounts of waste it produces."],"diet":["","Not a particularly vegetarian Loricariid, L. galaxias will accept most sinking dried foods, and also enjoys munching on meatier fare such as earthworms, prawns, mussels, bloodworm and suchlike. Oddly for a Loricariid, it also relishes snails."],"behaviour":["","Generally peaceful with species inhabiting other parts of the tank. In a biotope setup good tankmates include larger characins such as Anostomus, Hemiodus, Semaprochilodus and Metynnis species, reophilic cichlids such as Retroculus and in a big tank, other Loricariids requiring similar conditions. \nIt\u2019s territorial towards other benthic species, particularly those with similar colour patterns. A group would need very roomy quarters."],"reproduction":["","Has been bred in the hobby, but no details are available. It spawns in deep holes in river banks during the wet season in nature."],"create_time":1426712467.97161}
