Juveniles can be seen in quite shallow water around shorelines."],"maintenance":["","Decor isn\u2019t really important, as this is a pelagic roamers. Provide as much swimming space as possible, as it is capable of real bursts of speed. Rocky formations are not required but can be used if the tank contains other species that inhabit them. Filtration and tank maintenance need to be excellent on a tank containing fish of this size."],"diet":["","Piscivorous by nature but adapts well to prepared foods in captivity. Offer a varied diet using a good quality cichlid pellet as staple, along with lots of meaty fare such as prawns, mussels, earthworms etc. Take care not to overfeed as it is a particularly greedy species."],"behaviour":["","It\u2019s not particularly aggressive with anything too large to fit in its mouth. Small fish will definitely end up on the menu. With the exception of Mbuna, it can be kept with most Lake Malawi species growing larger than around 6\u2033. Conspecifics tend to be tolerated quite well, especially in roomy tanks."],"reproduction":["","Has been achieved in the hobby but details are very scarce. Maternal mouthbrooder."],"create_time":1426710779.47831}
