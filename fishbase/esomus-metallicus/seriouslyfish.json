In the latter of which it\u2019s also been recorded in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.","Also known from the Tonl\u00e9 Sap lake and river system in Cambodia, peninsular Thailand and the northern tip of Peninsular Malaysia.","It\u2019s abundant across the majority of this range with one interesting population existing on Don Khong island, the largest of the famous Si Phan Don or four thousand islands and situated in the main Mekong river channel, just below the Khone waterfalls in Champasak Province, Laos, while feral populations exist on the islands of Singapore and Borneo."],"habitat":["Found in various types of habitat but shows a marked preference for shallow, slow-moving and standing waters such as rice paddies and other temporally-inundated environments. According to Rainboth (1996) it moves into these at the onset of the wet season and only returns to permanent water bodies when the flooding recedes; one study found it to be one of the three most abundant\u00a0species\u00a0in rice paddies of southern Laos.","It has also been collected from muddy ditches, semi-polluted canals and small streams, but is generally absent from\u00a0major\u00a0river\u00a0channels."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not as critical as water quality although this species does look particularly effective in a well-planted tank with a dark substrate. The addition of some floating plants and driftwood roots or branches to diffuse the light\u00a0seems to reduce skittish behaviour as well as adding a more natural feel.","Water movement does not need to be particularly strong as it mostly hails from sluggish waters, and do not add this fish to a biologically-immature tank as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry. Also be sure to add a tightly-fitting cover as it\u2019s an accomplished jumper and able to escape through the tiniest of gaps."],"diet":"Feeds on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and their larvae in nature. In the aquarium it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered live and frozen Daphnia, Artemia, chironomid larvae (bloodworm), etc., on a regular basis.","behaviour":["There exist mixed reports on this species\u2019 suitability for community aquaria. Some have observed a pronounced tendency to nip the fins of tankmates while others report no problems. Any aggressive behaviour is likely to be more pronounced when it is maintained in insufficient numbers or with slow-moving or long-finned species.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0it\u2019s a shoaling rather than schooling fish which develops a hierarchical\u00a0pecking order. It therefore should always be maintained in a group of 8 or more\u00a0since weaker individuals may be bullied incessantly if smaller numbers are kept.\u00a0You\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking display plus interesting behaviour from the fish as they interact with one another."],"reproduction":"We\u2019re unsure whether it\u2019s been bred in captivity,\u00a0although it has been induced via the use of hormones for experimental purposes.","create_time":1426711680.80863}
