Has also been introduced to both Hawaii and the USA."],"habitat":["","Occurs in a variety of habitats, including rivers, ponds, rice paddies, canals, ditches and of course swamps. It can survive in very stagnant and polluted conditions, and during dry spells often burrows into wet earth, where it remains hidden until the rains return."],"maintenance":["","Provide the fish with plenty of hiding places. plants, bogwood, rocks and lengths of plastic piping can all be used. The tank absolutely must have an extremely tightly-fitting, heavy cover, as the eel will escape if given the slightest opportunity and could potentially travel a fair distance if it gets loose."],"diet":["","Feeds on a variety of prey in the wild, including fish, amphibians and invertebrates. In the aquarium it will accept prawns, white fish (such as lancefish) and earthworms."],"behaviour":["","Best kept singly and alone due to its large adult size and piscivorous nature."],"reproduction":["","Has not been spawned in captivity. In nature, spawning occurs in shallow waters, where the fish lay up to 1000 eggs in a loose bubble nest. This is then guarded by the male. It is not a seasonal spawner and breeds all year round. Interestingly, all the fry are initially female, with a percentage changing sex only when maturity is reached. In the event of females being scarce, males also retain the ability to reverse the change!"],"create_time":1426712754.27583}
