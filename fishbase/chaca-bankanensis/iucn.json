There is evidence that some populations currently identified as this species (e.g. from southern Borneo) represent unnamed species.","rationale":"Although there is no detailed information on the population status of this species, survey data indicates that it is still abundant in many parts of its known distribution. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern. However, it should be noted that the habitat of this species (blackwater peat swamp forests) has undergone large scale destruction and degradation (Yule 2008), and the effects of such massive habitat loss on the species should be further studied. &#160;It will be necessary to reassess this species once more information on the effect of habitat loss on the population is available.","assessor":"Ng, H.H.","evaluator":"Allen, D. & Smith, K."}]
