The use of a soft, sandy substrate is also recommended, as the fish often bury themselves. Most plants will not do well in such conditions, but tolerant species that grow attached to decor, such as java fern and java moss can be used. The addition of some beech twigs and dried leaves will help to simulate the natural habitat of the fish."],"diet":["","It is sometimes possible to wean young specimens onto dried or meaty frozen foods. However, many specimens refuse anything but live food. Small fish, river shrimp and earthworms can all be offered."],"behaviour":["","A highly predatory species, C. bankanensis is best kept alone. It will consume almost any fish that strays close enough to its capacious mouth, and is capable of swallowing prey items almost as big as itself. In large, deep aquaria it may be possible to keep it with fast-swimming species that live high in the water column, but even this carries risks. It can however be kept with others of its own kind with no problems."],"reproduction":["","Not known to have reproduced in captivity, but in all likelihood breeding occurs in a similar fashion to C. chaca."],"create_time":1426710855.39465}
