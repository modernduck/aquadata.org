Floating vegetation is also recommended in order to diffuse the light entering the tank."],"diet":["","Although it is omnivorous and will accept frozen and dried foods, S. pleurops is primarily a herbivore and a large component of the diet should be vegetable matter in the form of shelled peas, cucumber, algae wafers etc., which it will rasp at with the teeth in its lower jaw."],"behaviour":["","S. pleurops will rarely predate on other fish. It can be combined with most peaceful fish successfully but should not be housed with aggressive species. The most appropriate tankmates include African tetras, dwarf cichlids such as Pelvicachromis or Anomalochromis and small mormyrids."],"reproduction":["","Not achieved under natural conditions in aquaria, although captive breeding has occured on commercial fish farms via the use of hormone injections. Many of the young fish that come onto the market have been produced in this way. In nature, S. pleurops breeds in areas of seasonal flooding that are rich in micro-organisms. They are egg scatterers and exhibit no parental care."],"create_time":1426713973.27988}
