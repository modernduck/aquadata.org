It\u00a0was described from\u00a0Segamat District within the the Johor River watershed, Johor state, southern Peninsular Malaysia, but the\u00a0type\u00a0specimens were obtained via a Singapore wholesaler so it\u2019s possible that a mistake was made as there exist no other records of the\u00a0species\u00a0in Peninsular Malaysia.","Type locality is \u2018Johore River, Segamat, Malaysia\u2019.","Specimens collected\u00a0from the Kapuas drainage in Kalimantan Barat (West Kalimantan) province, Indonesia (Borneo)\u00a0and initially identified as\u00a0this species were\u00a0subsequently described as Rasbora kalbarensis (Kottelat, 1991). There appears to be a possibility that it is endemic to Sumatra, since a\u00a0record from\u00a0the Batang Hari river, in Jambi province (Tan & Kottelat, 2009) appears to represent the first official\u00a0record\u00a0since the description was published."],"habitat":"Presumably inhabits quiet forested streams and tributaries containing relatively clear water, although we\u2019ve been unable to obtain any definitive information to date.","maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not as critical as water quality although it tends to display better colouration when maintained in a well-planted set-up with a dark substrate. The addition of some floating plants and driftwood roots or branches to diffuse the light entering the tank also seems to be appreciated and adds a more natural feel.","Do not add this fish to a biologically immature tank as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry, and be sure to add a tightly-fitting cover since it is an accomplished jumper."],"diet":"Likely to prey\u00a0on small insects, worms, crustaceans and such like\u00a0in nature. In the aquarium it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but also offer daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia\u00a0or\u00a0Artemia.","behaviour":["This species makes an ideal addition to a well-chosen\u00a0community\u00a0but will not compete well with much larger or more boisterous species.","In a biotope-style arrangement you could try it alongside other species from the Batang Hari drainge such as Desmopuntius\u00a0johorensis, Rasbora cephalotaenia,\u00a0R. einthovenii,\u00a0Brevibora doorsiocellata,\u00a0Trigonopoma pauciperforatum, T. gracile, Trigonostigma hengeli,\u00a0Pangio anguillaris,\u00a0P.\u00a0oblonga, or\u00a0P. semicincta. It also makes an ideal companion for timid\u00a0anabantoids such as Sphaerichthys or the more diminutive Betta species.","It is a schooling species by nature and really should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens. Maintaining it in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but will result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Males will also display their best colours as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care. In a well-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019 is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller\u00a0tank\u00a0with a\u00a0base\u00a0measuring around 45 cm x 30 cm should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water. This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles. Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or wool mops can also return decent results. The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced. If ready\u00a0spawning\u00a0usually taking place within 24 hours, signified by the female appearing noticeably slimmer. After 48 hours the adults should be removed whether\u00a0spawning\u00a0has occurred or not.","Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but typically lasts 18-28 hours with the young free-swimming 1-2 days later. Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or similar, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, powdered dry foods, etc., once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712323.58672}
