Plenty of cover should also be provided, particularly if you\u2019re keeping several together. Smooth rocks, driftwood, lengths of pvc piping and plants that can survive under low levels of light, such as Anubias sp., Java fern and Vallisneria can all be used."],"diet":["","Unfussy. It relishes live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, earthworms etc., as well as sinking dried foods. Add food after lights out to ensure it receives its share."],"behaviour":["","Generally peaceful and shy, although it can sometimes be a little territorial with other benthic species. Small fish will be eaten during the hours of darkness. Ideally keep it in a South American biotope aquarium, with similarly-sized characins, cichlids and other peaceful catfish and and Loricariids. It\u2019s quite gregarious and appears to be happier in the company of conspecifics, so keep a small group if space allows."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in aquaria. Fertilisation occurs internally."],"create_time":1426712512.04526}
