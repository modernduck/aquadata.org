The population in Niger delta is threatened due to an ongoing decline in habitat quality due to the combined effects of oil exploration, urban, agricultural and commercial developments. In the Fifinda region the species is threatened from barrage fishing leading to sedimentation and habitat loss (threat not overfishing). The species is also threatened by the oil palm plantations in the northern coastal regions. The EOO is more than 20,000km, but the AOO is less than 2,000 km, and therefore this species is considered to be Vulnerable. If the species is found to be more widespread, it can be reassessed as Least Concern. In regional assessments of central and western Africa it has also been classified as Vulnerable.","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Moelants, T. & Olaosebikan, B.D.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
