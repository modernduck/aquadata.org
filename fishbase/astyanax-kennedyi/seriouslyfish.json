A few handfuls of dried beech or oak leaves completes the effect. It should also do well in a planted aquarium.","diet":"Apparently preys on invertebrates and smaller fishes in nature. Its captive diet should contain plenty of small live and frozen morsels alongside good quality dried foods.","behaviour":"Shouldn\u2019t be kept with very tiny fish as it might predate on them but suitable for most communities of similarly-sized, peaceful species. Ideal tankmates include characins, non-piscivorous South American cichlids plus catfishes from the families Callichthyidae and?\u00a0Loricariidae.","reproduction":"Unreported in the hobby as far as we know.","create_time":1426710317.63399}
