Another population was discovered in the Irrawaddy delta near Einme. A third locality was identified near Mandalay in 1996; the site was resurveyed in 2003 but the species was not found.<br/><br/>The three known locations represent a large area of the Irrawaddy system, but there is not information on the species distribution between these areas; the upper Irrawaddy has not been heavily surveyed and further populations may be present. Parts of the southern part of Myanmar has also not been heavily sampled. It is potentially easily overlooked.<br/><br/>Whilst the species does not have a large number of known localities, these are widespread through the Irrawaddy basin, and it is at least assessed as Least Concern. further work is clearly required, especially following the recent Cyclone Nargis which most likely impacted the southern Delta population. In addition, further taxonomic work is required to confirm that all three species are a single species.","assessor":"Britz, R.","evaluator":"Jha, B.R., Datta, N.C., Chaudhry, S. & Allen, D.J."}]
