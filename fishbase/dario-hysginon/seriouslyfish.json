B. corycaeus is found in running water towards the margins of the stream, B. kyar in the faster flow towards the centre and D. hysginon only in still pools around the shoreline.","A number of other fishes were found at this location from Acanthocobitis, Schistura, Danio and Puntius to Pillaia, Indostomus and Microphis species.","In Lake Indawgyi it occurs alongside B. corycaeus with both species collected from heavily-vegetated marginal zones.","The substrate of the lake is a soft, rich clay mixed with high levels of decomposing plant material, while aquatic vegetation and various kinds of algae proliferate including Vallisneria, Elodea and Spirogyra species.","According to Kullander and Britz (2002) D. hysginon is most abundant in marginal, marshy zones containing stagnant water with sympatric fishes including Parasphaerichthys ocellatus, Heteropneustes fossilis, Oryzias, Esomus, Channa and Anabas species; all typical inhabitants of oxygen-deprived environments."],"maintenance":["Best-maintained in a well-structured arrangement with plenty of cover.","A soft substrate is preferable although fine-grade gravel is acceptable, while ideal plants include Cryptocoryne spp. or those that can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor such as Microsorum, Anubias, or Taxiphyllum species.","The latter is particularly useful as it\u2019s also an ideal spawning substrate, and driftwood branches, floating plants and leaf litter can all be used as well."],"diet":["Dario\u00a0species\u00a0are micropredators feeding on small\u00a0aquatic\u00a0crustaceans, worms, insect\u00a0larvae\u00a0and other\u00a0zooplankton.","In captivity they should\u00a0be offered small live or frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia, grindal, micro-, and banana worm.","They\u2019re noted as somewhat shy, deliberate feeders (see \u2018Behaviour and Compatibility\u2019) and it\u2019s also important to note that all badids develop issues with obesity and become more susceptible to disease when fed chironomid larvae (bloodworm) and/or\u00a0Tubifex\u00a0so these should be omitted from the diet."],"behaviour":["Given its\u00a0rarity\u00a0the emphasis should be on captive\u00a0reproduction\u00a0and we strongly recommend maintaining it alone.","It\u2019s not a\u00a0gregarious\u00a0fish as such and rival males can be very aggressive towards one another, especially in smaller tanks.","In these cases only a single\u00a0pair\u00a0or one male and several females should be purchased but in roomier surroundings a group can coexist provided there is space for each male to establish a\u00a0territory\u00a0and plenty of broken lines of sight.","Thoughtful\u00a0placement of caves and boundaries can help tremendously in this respect so don\u2019t be tempted to cluster all available\u00a0spawning\u00a0sites in one area of the\u00a0tank, for example.","If you do intend to house it in a\u00a0community\u00a0tankmates must be chosen with care.","It\u2019s slow-moving with a retiring nature and will easily be intimidated or outcompeted for food by larger or more boisterous tankmates.","Peaceful,\u00a0pelagic\u00a0cyprinids such as\u00a0Microdevario,\u00a0Boraras,\u00a0Trigonostigma\u00a0or smaller\u00a0Rasbora\u00a0species\u00a0make good choices as do diminutive loaches such as some members of the\u00a0genus\u00a0Petruichthys."],"reproduction":["Substrate-spawner forming temporary\u00a0pair\u00a0bonds.","Other fishes\u00a0are best omitted if you want to raise good numbers of\u00a0fry, although in a\u00a0mature, well-furnished\u00a0community\u00a0a few may survive to adulthood.","Either a single\u00a0pair\u00a0or a group of adults can be used but if using multiple males be sure to provide each with space to form a\u00a0territory\u00a0with\u00a0around 30 cm\u00b2 per individual adequate.","One male will usually become dominant meaning the others will not be involved in breeding.","Water parameters should be within the values suggested above and the fish conditioned with plenty of live and frozen foods.","As they come into breeding condition males will begin to form territories and display\u00a0courtship\u00a0behaviour alongside\u00a0an intensified colour pattern.","This can be prolonged for several days with the female often being chased away then courted again minutes later.","The male will make a non-aggressive approach towards the female and appear to \u2018invite\u2019 her into the centre of his\u00a0territory, and\u00a0if ready to\u00a0spawn\u00a0she will follow.","The act itself is over in just a few seconds with eggs being scattered in a random fashion on the underside of a solid surface such as a plant leaf.","Post-spawning\u00a0the female is ejected and the male takes sole responsibility for the\u00a0territory.","If you want to maximise the numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0raised now is the time to either remove the medium to a container containing water from the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0or the adults as the\u00a0fry\u00a0will be preyed upon\u00a0once hatched.","The\u00a0incubation period\u00a0should be 2-3 days after which the\u00a0fry\u00a0may need up to a week to fully absorb the\u00a0yolk sac.","They are very small indeed and will require an infusoria-type diet until large enough to accept microworm, Artemia nauplii, and suchlike."],"create_time":1426711531.29259}
