Aquatic plants such as Microsorum, Bolbitis or Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor and bright lighting will promote the growth of aufwuchs which will add to the natural feel.","In this kind of environment the fish will show more natural behaviour and can be maintained alongside other species that enjoy similar conditions (see \u2018compatibility\u2019).","Although a high level of water movement isn\u2019t essential it\u2019s also proven to thrive in a mature hill stream-type set-up with a rocky aquascape."],"diet":["Chiefly a micropredator feeding on insect larvae and suchlike in nature.","In the aquarium it will accept sinking dried foods but should also be offered regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia, Artemia, bloodworm, etc. A varied diet is the key to maintaining it in the best of health."],"behaviour":["Generally peaceful and can be maintained alongside many of the more popular species in the hobby although ideally fishes from from one of its native countries or rivers should be selected.","Most small, peaceful schooling or shoaling cyprinids\u00a0are excellent choices as are many other loaches such as Lepidocephalichthys and some Nemacheilus spp.","In a hill stream-style set-up it can also be housed with rheophilic loaches such as\u00a0Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon, Beaufortia and Sewellia spp., but more aggressive nemacheilids, e.g., similarly-sized Schistura spp. are best avoided.","It exists in loose aggregations in nature and can exhibit shy or skittish behaviour if kept singly or in small numbers so buy a group of six or more. You\u00b4ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking display plus interesting behaviour from the fish as they interact with conspecifics.","Some specimens have been known to nip the fins of rivals."],"reproduction":["As far as we know it\u2019s not bred\u00a0commercially and all fish available in the trade are probably collected from wild stocks.","There do exist a few reports of fry being found in mature, well-decorated aquaria although the numbers recovered were very small and it seems likely this species eats its eggs given the opportunity.","UK aquarist Mick Wright has had success with the related A. zonalternans so perhaps an upscaled version of his approach would be a good starting point; see the relevant section of that species profile for more information."],"create_time":1426709855.62746}
