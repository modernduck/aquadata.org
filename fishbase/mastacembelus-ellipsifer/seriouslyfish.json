It is essential that the tank base is covered in a layer of sand, as the fish spends much of it\u2019s time burrowed in the substrate. Gravel is not recommended as its sharp edges can damage the eel\u2019s skin. There should also be no strong currents in the aquarium. Dim lighting is preferable if you want to see your eel regularly, as it is a nocturnal species by nature."],"diet":["","In nature, the spiny eel preys on small fish but aquarium specimens readily accept dead alternatives. Prawn, cockle, mussel, earthworms and bloodworm can all be offered."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful with species it cannot fit into its mouth. Not suitable for most freshwater tanks due to its hard, alkaline water requirements. It is best kept in a Tanganyikan community, where it can be combined with any species too large to be considered food. It tends to be territorial with conspecifics, so a large tank is required if more than one is to be kept."],"reproduction":["","Has not been bred in the hobby."],"create_time":1426712563.42688}
