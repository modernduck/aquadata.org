This species was previously thought to be very widespread and variable in form, ranging from the Indus River eastwards to the northern part of the Malay Peninsula (Hora 1933). However, Ng and Kottelat (2000) restrict <em>A. mangois</em> to the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. Although some sources consider <em>Pimelodus indicus</em> McClelland, 1842 to be a junior subjective synonym of <em>A. mangois</em> (e.g. Menon 1999), Ng and Kottelat (2000) show that this is most likely a bagrid catfish instead.","rationale":"Although some anthropogenic threats to this species have been documented (Prasad <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al.</span>1997), these are deemed to be speculatory and not based on hard evidence. Given that this species is relatively common and abundant throughout the sub-Himalayan region (in the Ganges and Brahmaputra river drainages), <em>Amblyceps mangois</em> is assessed as Least Concern here.","assessor":"Pal, M. & Ng, H.H.","evaluator":"Vishwanath, W., Britz, R. & Molur, S."}]
