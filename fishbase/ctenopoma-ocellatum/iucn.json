It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for central Africa. Within the west Africa region, this species is only known from the Niger Delta (one location). The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy thresholds are estimated at less than 100 km\u00b2 and less than 10 km\u00b2, respectively. In Nigeria the location is affected by oil exploration, so the quality of habitat is declining. Because of those reasons, the species can be qualified as Critically Endangered regionally.","assessor":"Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P. & Moelants, T.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
