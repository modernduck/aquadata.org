Organise a separate tank for breeding purposes unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","It should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the fry need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the labyrinth organ can be impaired.","The pair need not be separated prior to spawning. The male may construct the nest in a tube or canister, under a broad plant leaf or among fine-leaved surface vegetation, and will not usually tolerate the female in the vicinity until it\u2019s complete.","Spawning normally occurrs beneath the nest in an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids, with the male wrapping himself around the female.","At the point of climax milt and a few eggs are released and both fish collect and transfer them to his nest. This cycle is then repeated until the female is spent of eggs, a process that can take some time.","Post-spawning the adults can normally be left in situ although the female is no longer actively involved with the male assuming sole responsibility for guarding and tending the nest.","The eggs hatch in 24-48 hours, remaining in the nest for a further 2-3 days until the yolk sac is fully-absorbed, while the male continues to collecting and return any that fall.","Once the fry begin to swim freely the male will lose interest, but the adults do not usually eat their offspring.","The fry will require an infusoria-type food for the first few days, after which they should be large enough to accept microworm and Artemia nauplii.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones."],"create_time":1426714125.27074}
