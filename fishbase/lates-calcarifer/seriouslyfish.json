It occurs eastward from the Persian Gulf through India, Thailand, China and Japan, and then southward through Indonesia and Australia."],"habitat":["","Found in a wide variety of habitats, from freshwater rivers and lakes, to brackish and marine coastal waters. It tends to prefer areas with submerged cover, such as logs and rocky overhangs."],"maintenance":["","Speaking hypothetically, decor would not be critical. Obviously an enormous filtration system would be needed to cope with the massive amounts of biological waste a fish of this size produces. The species is very tolerant of saline conditions, and could be kept in a brackish or marine system if necessary."],"diet":["","Highly piscivorous in nature, juvenile captive specimens have been known to accept prawns, lancefish etc. An adult fish would need large amounts of whole fish such as trout. Keeping one of these fully fed would certainly be an expensive proposition. Larger specimens should be fed with care as they tend to strike quite savagely when feeding."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful with anything it can\u2019t fit into its mouth. This doesn\u2019t actually leave many available species that it can be housed with in the long term though. Young specimens have been successfully cohabited with tankmates such as Cichla sp., Datnioides sp., arowana and tankbusting catfish."],"reproduction":["","Surely impossible in aquaria, even more so when you consider the fish are diadromous in nature; migrating from fresh to brackish or marine water to spawn. Interestingly all individuals are born as and spend the first few years of life as males, before some change sex to become female."],"create_time":1426712406.79296}
