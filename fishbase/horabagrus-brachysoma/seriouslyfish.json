Ensure that any decor is either secured or is too heavy to be moved around by the fish. A large and efficient biologocal filter is needed to cope with the amounts of waste produced by a fish of this size."],"diet":["","Feeds on smaller fish, invertebrates and plant matter in nature, although thankfully there is no need to offer live \u2018feeder\u2019 fish in the aquarium. Most specimens are easy to feed, accepting a wide range of dried and meaty frozen foods. Feed a mixture of dried pellets as well as frozen prawns, mussels, earthworms etc."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful for its size and does well in a community of other placid, similarly-sized fish. It will eat any tankmate it can fit in its mouth, so be warned. Decent choices include larger cyprininds and characins, other big catfish, Arowana, Polypterus, Datnioides and Cichla species. Obviously, a tank much larger than the minimum size suggested above would be needed to house this type of community. It will not squabble with conspecifics and can be kept singly or as a small group."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in captivity."],"create_time":1426712071.33133}
