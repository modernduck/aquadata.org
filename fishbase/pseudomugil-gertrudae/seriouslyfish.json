Do not add this fish to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry."],"diet":["Feeds chiefly on floating or suspended zooplankton, phytoplankton, and invertebrates in nature, and in the aquarium must be offered items of a suitable size.","Ideally much of the diet should comprise live foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, micro worm, etc., although small/crushed floating dried foods are also accepted."],"behaviour":["Peaceful but unsuitable for the general\u00a0community\u00a0aquarium since\u00a0it\u2019s easily outcompeted and quite timid.","It\u2019s best maintained alone or alongside fishes of comparable size, disposition, and requirements and freshwater shrimp of the genera Caridina and Neocaridina but in all cases be sure to research your choices thoroughly prior to purchase.","P. gertrudae\u00a0is a shoaling\u00a0species\u00a0and should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens, ideally more. Maintaining it in such numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but result in a more effective, natural-looking display.","Males will also display their best colours and some fascinating behaviour as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["This species is an egg-scatterer exhibiting no parental care and will consume its own eggs and fry given the opportunity.","Spawning is more likely in temperatures towards the upper end of the range suggested above, with females capable of depositing a few eggs daily for a period of several days,\u00a0these being attached to aquatic vegetation or other substrate by adhesive filaments.","An individual male may also mate with multiple females during a single day, and spawning usually continues throughout daylight hours during warmer periods.","In nature it displays a seasonal reproductive cycle coinciding with the onset of the wet season, around October-December, when food and aquatic vegetation are at their most plentiful.","Spawning occurs during daylight hours with a peak of activity in late morning/early afternoon when water temperature is 24-28 \u00b0C, and in the aquarium breeding can occur throughout the year if temperature is raised to these values.","There exist two basic methods for aquarium breeding.","The first involves isolating a small group comprising a single male and two or three females into a container with an air-powered sponge filter and spawning medium in the form of nylon mops or aquatic moss.","The medium is checked several times per day and any eggs removed to a separate container for incubation and hatching.","The alternative is to maintain a colony of adults in a larger, fully-decorated set-up which if well-planted should allow some fry to survive.","Since the latter spend the early part of life close to the water surface aquatic mosses from the genus Taxiphylum attached to d\u00e9cor high in the water column apparently produce the most favourable results, but floating plants with trailing roots are also recommended.","The latter approach is normally less productive but simpler and more reliable as mature, planted aquaria facilitate relatively stable water conditions and the resident microfauna can constitute a valuable early food source for fish fry.","The incubation period is around 10 days depending on temperature and the fry require microscopic food such as\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0for up to 5 days before they\u2019re able to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, micro worm, and similarly-sized foods immediately.","They can also be raised using good quality, powdered dry products of which some are available in incrementally-graded particle sizes, and growth rate is normally quite fast compared with some congeners.","Should eggs containing developed embryos fail to hatch they can apparently be stimulated to do so by putting\u00a0them in a small vial or similar container with some water from the aquarium and shaking it vigorously, or placing it in your pocket and walking around with it.\u00a0It appears the resultant change in pressure causes the eggs to hatch.","Small meals should be offered at least twice daily.\u00a0Aged water can result in high mortality so regular, small water changes are essential and uneaten food should not be allowed to accumulate in the rearing tank.","Pseudomugil\u00a0spp. are quite short-lived with females tending to survive for only a single reproductive season in nature.","Though lifespan tends to increase in well-maintained aquaria the fish will normally be less fecund once they reach an age of 12-18 months."],"create_time":1426713473.05487}
