It is restricted to rocky habitat and is susceptible to impacts from dam development.&#160; <br/><br/>It is assessed as Near Threatened on the basis of population declines and future habitat loss resulting from proposed dam development; several of the planned mainstream Mekong dams (e.g., the Ban Koum, Latseua and Pak Chom dams in Lao PDR and Thailand; the Sambor and Stung Treng dams in Cambodia) will impact upon populations of the species. However the scale of the impact and the timing of dam developments are not certain. A high proportion of the species population is likely to be impacted by dam construction as they are in the rocky habitat preferred by the species.<br/><br/>Further research is required, and it is possible that the species would qualify for a threatened category if all proposed dams are constructed within the species range.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Rainboth, W. & Allen, D.J."}]
