An abundance of hiding places should be provided as this species likes to hide away during the day. Bogwood, rock caves and PVC piping are all suitable for this purpose. Sand should be used as substrate as the spiny eels often like to bury themselves. Dimmer lighting will encourage the fish to venture from its hiding places more often. A close-fitting hood is required as the eel can find its way through the smallest of gaps. Water flow should be fairly gentle as the fish mainly inhabits areas of still water in the wild.","diet":"Wild fish are omnivorous and consume a variety of smaller fish, aquatic invertebrates, plant matter and detritus. Prefers meaty foods such as prawn, krill, and lancefish. Live and frozen foods can also be fed, however these foods alone are unlikely to be enough to sustain larger fish. Some specimens will also accept vegetable matter, although this is fairly rare.","behaviour":"Generally peaceful community fish, although care should be taken to ensure tankmates are too large to be considered prey as this species does eat live fish in the wild. It is recommended to only keep one fire eel per tank as they may be aggressive to conspecifics. This can sometimes be avoided by keeping the fish in groups of five or more individuals.","reproduction":"Has been occasionally bred in the aquarium but this has been accidental.","create_time":1426712567.20621}
