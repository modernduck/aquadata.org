Long. 62\u00b020\u2032, Brazil\u2019.","In recent years very similar-looking fish with an additional thin dark stripe in the lower portion of the body (see \u2018Notes\u2019) have been exported with Colombia given as origin, and it may also occur in Peru."],"habitat":"Inhabits sluggish tributaries, small rivers and swampy areas, particularly in areas with dense growth of aquatic vegetation or submerged woody structures and leaf litter.","maintenance":["Should ideally be kept in a heavily-planted\u00a0set-up, preferably with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The broken lines of sight that exist in such a display allow it to display natural behaviour as well as helping to reduce skittishness.","Floating plants are a useful addition as are driftwood branches and dried leaf litter, the latter in particular driving\u00a0establishment of microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs.","Such microorganisms can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also thought beneficial.","Use gentle filtration; an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","In a community it\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with rival males sparring on a regular basis during daylight hours.","It\u2019s not uncommon to see nipped fins within a group though this behaviour does not normally extend to tankmates.","Buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour."],"reproduction":"Unreported.","create_time":1426712829.90593}
