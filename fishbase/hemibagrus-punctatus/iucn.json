Subsequent and recent surveys in the rivers have not recorded this species thereby suggesting a drastic decline of close to 100% due to habitat loss and other threats that are not yet clearly understood. The species' identity may need further scrutiny in some locations it has been reported from, and in addition the confirmed locations need to be surveyed thoroughly before its status can be assessed as Extinct. It is therefore presently assessed as Critically Endangered (possibly extinct).","assessor":"Raghavan, R. & Ali, A.","evaluator":"Arunachalam, M., Madhusoodana Kurup, B., Basheer, V.S., Abraham, R., Shaji, C.P. & Molur, S."}]
