{"images":[],"distribution":["","Thought to be endemic to a particular section of the Rio S\u00c3\u00a3o Francisco plus associated tributaries including the Rio Itapicur\u00c3\u00b9 and Rio das Velhas in eastern Brazil."],"habitat":["","The S\u00c3\u00a3o Francisco is the fourth longest river in South America and is over 3000km long. It passes through areas of rainforest as well as semi-arid regions, and thus features many different types of aquatic habitat. S. brandtii is known to occur in both the main river channels and marginal lakes and reservoirs across its range. It\u2019s thought to be something of a pelagic roamer and probably inhabits open water, occuring sympatrically with Pygocentrus piraya."],"maintenance":["","S. brandtii lives in open rivers and thus a well-oxygenated set-up with a sandy substrate and some good-sized driftwood roots and branches should simulate its habitat quite closely. The cover provided by the wood will also be appreciated by this sometimes skittish species, as will the use of only dim to moderate lighting. You can attempt to grow aquatic plants if you wish, but many of the commonly available types will fail to thrive in the flowing conditions preferred by the fish. Don\u2019t be surprised if it nips at any plants a bit as many some members of the genus are now known to be omnivorous animals. ","Water quality must be of the highest order for this species to thrive, and a decent rate of flow seems to suit it best. Use an external canister-style filter or sump, arranging the pipework so that water is returned lengthways along the tank. Place the spraybar so that it agitates the water surface a little, and consider the use of an extra powerhead or two to add further oxygenation and flow. As usual when keeping large, predatory species weekly partial water changes of up to 50% are a must.","If possible the heaterstat should also be situated externally, as serrasalmids been known to attack both these and other items of equipment when they are located inside the tank. It\u2019s possible to buy external filters with built-in heater elements, or inline units that can be fitted to the filter pipework. Failing these a sturdy heater-guard should be considered a minimum requirement."],"diet":["","Wild fish feed mainly on the fins of other species as well as smaller fish and insects. Some Serrasalmus have also been shown to eat nuts, fruits and seeds and small amounts of plant material have been found in the gut of Serrasalmus brandtii during laboratory analyses. In the aquarium most individuals can be weaned onto dead foods over time, although some seem to find it trickier to adjust than others and may refuse to feed initially. A period of starvation may be necessary, eventually giving the fish little choice but to accept what is offered. This is especially true of larger or recently-transported specimens.","Once acclimatised juveniles relish live or frozen bloodworm, Tubifex, Artemia, chopped prawns and similar foods. Adults should be fed correspondingly larger items, such as whole mussels, cockles, prawns, chopped squid, whitebait and earthworms. Once the fish reaches adult size it need only be fed two or three times a week.","This species should not be fed large amounts of mammalian/avian meat such as beef heart or chicken. Some of the lipids contained in these meats cannot be properly metabolised by the fish, and can cause excess deposits of fat and even organ degeneration. Similarly there is no benefit in the use of \u2018feeder\u2019 fish such as livebearers or small goldfish. Risks involved with these include the possible introduction of disease or parasites."],"behaviour":["","Should only be considered as a specimen fish for the enthusiast. This species doesn\u2019t make a good tankmate for anything else. Scattered reports of it coexisting with Loricariids, armoured catfish and in conspecific groups should be considered tenuous at best given its natural diet. There is little point attempting to keep two or more of these together. Although juveniles may school in large numbers it is not a gregarious animal when adult and conspecifics are liable to fight until only one remains. Experiments in which it has been successfully maintained with groups of Pygocentrus species have occured, but only in massive tanks by aquarists with many years\u2019 experience of these fish."],"reproduction":["","Has not been spawned in the hobby."],"create_time":1426713782.156}
