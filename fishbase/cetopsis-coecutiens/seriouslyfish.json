It\u2019s found in the Amazon, Tocantins, and Orinoco River basins."],"habitat":["","Predominantly swims in open water in large, flowing rivers."],"maintenance":["","Decor isn\u2019t particularly critical but water movement is. It does best with a good degree of flow running through the tank. Try to position the filter return so that it breaks the surface. The agitation created by this will provide the desired levels of dissolved oxygen. Alternatively, position a powerhead at one end of the tank. Dim lighting is also preferable, as its natural waters are usually quite deep and murky. It is much more active under these conditions."],"diet":["","There\u2019s no need to provide live fish, as it is an eager and aggressive feeder. Offer a meaty diet of frozen and live foods such as prawns, mussel, cockle, lancefish, earthworms etc. Some specimens will even accept dried foods. It is so greedy that overfeeding comes very easily."],"behaviour":["","Best kept alone, as not only will it eat smaller tankmates, it will often bite chunks out of larger fish as well. In nature, it has been seen ripping pieces of flesh from much bigger fish than itself. Some success has been had with keeping it in groups, as it seems less likely to regard conspecifics as a source of food."],"reproduction":["","Unknown. Certainly not achieved in the hobby to date."],"create_time":1426710851.59757}
