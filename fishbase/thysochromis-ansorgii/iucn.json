It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for western Africa. For central Africa it has been categorised as Data Deficient - <em>Thysochromis ansorgii</em> is known from the lower Cross River and swampy locations in the Calabar and Great Kwa drainages, and the Ogowe basin. Teugels <em>et al.</em> (1991) recorded the presence of two specimens from Lac Kobambi in the Kouilou-Niari system of Congo-Brazzaville. Examination of these specimens confirms their identification as <em>Thysochromis</em>, and preliminary analysis reveals no obvious differences with <em>T. ansorgii</em>. The presence of <em>Thysochromis ansorgii</em> in Congo-Brazzaville is a significant southerly range extension. More information is needed on the species distribution before an assessment can be made for central Africa.","assessor":"Moelants, T.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
