Make sure a varied diet of frozen foods are given, though live foods will undoubtedly be preferred. Be prepared to find an easily renewable source of live foods for this fish."],"behaviour":["","Taeniacara Candidi are said to be one of the most aggressive dwarf cichlids around. Some reports intone that the male is hyper-aggressive, whereas other reports tell of the female being the boss of the Candidi setup. If more than one male is placed in a tank smaller than 48\u2033, it is highly likely that the dominant male will kill all of the other males."],"reproduction":["","Some reports indicate that breeding Taeniacara Candid is extremely difficult. However, there have been frequent reports of Candidi breeding in the home aquarium. Some people have had luck breeding this species of Taeniacara in water with pH as high as 7, but it is generally accepted that a very acidic pH combined with very low GH will be required to breed Taeniacara Candidi."],"create_time":1426713980.96408}
