Since hill streams across the region are threatened by habitat degradation caused by deforestation, mining and agriculture and the species is restricted to narrow habitat range (high gradient rocky streams) with limited population size. &#160;Although <em>Balitora brucei</em> has a wide distribution range, it is restricted only to mountain streams which are under severe threat. &#160;More studies are required to establish the exact status of this species, which most likely could be threatened. &#160;It is here assessed as Near threatened.","assessor":"Britz, R.","evaluator":"Rema Devi, K.R., Daniel, B.A., Arunachalam, M., Dahanukar, N. & Allen, D.J."}]
