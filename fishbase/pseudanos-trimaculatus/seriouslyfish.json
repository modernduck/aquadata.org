Algal growth should not be discouraged. If kept in a planted aquarium, any soft-leaved varieties will be eaten and even the tougher species will be picked at. Water flow should be quite strong. A well-fitting cover is essential as Pseudanos are excellent jumpers."],"diet":["","Though it is omnivorous, this species is primarily a herbivore. Offer live and frozen foods as well as plenty of vegetable matter in the form of blanched spinach, lettuce, cucumber, courgette, algae wafers etc."],"behaviour":["","Aggressive towards its own kind when kept in small numbers, it can be maintained in groups of 6 fish or more in larger aquaria. Otherwise, keep as a single specimen in a community of medium to large fish. Suitable choices include larger characins (but not other Anostomids), Loricariids, Doradids, peaceful Cichlids, knifefish, Corydoras etc. It may nip at long-finned fish, especially slow-moving species."],"reproduction":["","Not reported in aquaria."],"create_time":1426713454.31875}
