Its dispersal has been artificially-led to an extent as it\u2019s prized as both a food and sport fish and has been introduced to numerous water bodies.","Type locality is \u2018Bogor, Java, Indonesia\u2019."],"habitat":["Predominantly a\u00a0riverine\u00a0fish preferring clear, well-oxygenated, running water with substrates of\u00a0sand,\u00a0gravel, rock or mud although it\u2019s adaptable\u00a0and can be found in both upland and lowland, standing or flowing waters.","During the rainy season it is known to\u00a0migrate\u00a0into areas of inundated forest to feed and\u00a0spawn, and it can now be found in many impounded water bodies as a result of human activity including agriculture and damming of\u00a0river\u00a0channels.\u00a0Larger specimens apparently tend to frequent deep pools of main river channels, and often converge among\u00a0submerged tree trunks and branches."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not as critical as water quality and the amount of open swimming-space provided. However should you possess the means to both provide and decorate a sufficiently-sized aquarium\u00a0this\u00a0species\u00a0a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks and\u00a0gravel, some large water-worn boulders and perhaps a couple of driftwood branches is recommended.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running waters it\u2019s intolerant to the accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water at all times in order to thrive. It also does best if there is a high level of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and a decent level of water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0so external filters, powerheads, etc., should be employed in order to obtain the desired effect.","Be sure to fit the aquarium\u00a0with a heavy, tightly-fitting cover as larger cyprinids can be quite skittish at times and usually possess a powerful leap."],"diet":["Primarily a predator with stomach analyses of wild specimens demonstrating it to feed on smaller fishes and insects along with a variety of freshwater crustaceans\u00a0and plant material, the latter likely taken via the stomach contents of prey items.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods but should not be fed these exclusively with daily meals of live and frozen foods key to keeping it in the best of health.","Smaller specimens can be offered chironomid larvae (bloodworm), small earthworms, chopped prawn and suchlike while adults will take whole prawns, larger earthworms, mussels, whitebait,\u00a0etc. Take care not to overfeed as it will gorge itself given the opportunity.","It should not be fed large amounts of mammalian/avian meat such as beef heart or chicken. Some of the lipids contained in these meats cannot be properly metabolised by the fish and can cause excess deposits of fat and even organ degeneration. Similarly there is no benefit in the use of \u2018feeder\u2019 fish such as livebearers or small goldfish which carry with them associated risks such as the introduction of parasites or disease.","Hampala\u00a0spp. are voracious feeders especially when maintained in numbers. Some aquarists have observed that the \u2018alpha\u2019 individual in a group will lead the others in a pack-style behaviour, and anglers\u2019 reports state that the water surface will literally boil when a\u00a0shoal\u00a0is feeding. So enthusiastically does it attack food that it is sometimes recommended as a useful tankmate for fastidious or newly-introduced fishes that are refusing to eat."],"behaviour":["Captures its prey using suction rather than aggressively biting and otherwise peaceful with anything it can\u2019t swallow, although its speed of movement and\u00a0feeding habits suggest that slow-moving or timid tankmates would probably be outcompeted. Smaller specimens are easy to maintain alongside other\u00a0species\u00a0but as they grow become increasingly powerful and domineering when food is available meaning\u00a0companions must be chosen with care.","Similarly-sized cyprinids, characids, catfishes and perhaps larger botiid loaches constitute the best choices. A large Mekong-themed\u00a0community\u00a0could be an interesting project with options including\u00a0Barbonymus,\u00a0Cyclocheilichthys,\u00a0Osteochilus, and\u00a0Hypsibarbus\u00a0species among\u00a0many others.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0which develops a distinct\u00a0pecking order\u00a0and therefore should always be maintained in a group of five or more. If only two or three are present the subdominant fish may be subjected to excessive antagonism whereas solitary specimens tend to act rather nervously."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded.","create_time":1426711889.07378}
