There are several subspecies of <i>C. auratus</i>, all indigenous to Asia, including <i>C. auratus argenteaphthalmus</i> (Vietnam), <i>C. auratus buergeri</i>, <i>C. auratus grandoculis</i>, and <i>C. auratus langsdorfii</i> (Japan); however the best known subspecies is <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://eol.org/pages/1298984/overview%E2%80%9D\"><i>Carassius auratus auratus</i></a>, the common domesticated goldfish.  <i>Carassius auratus</i> is often confused with <i>C. gibelio</i>, the Prussian carp or Gibel carp, the wild species from which <i>C. auratus</i> was bred about 1000 years ago in China for aquaria, ornamental ponds and as a food fish.  Like <i>C. gibelio</i>, wild <i>C. auratus</i> are a greenish color, omnivorous, live in slow-moving waters, and are hardy, even in non-native or slightly polluted/turbid environments.  They have been introduced throughout the world, both intentionally and unintentionally, and in some places negatively impact their environment by competing with and preying on native species, causing increased incidence of algal blooms, and increasing water turbidity. \r\n\r\n(Komiyama et al. 2009; <a href=\"http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=368\">Rowe 2010</a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goldfish&amp;oldid=474768577\">Wikipedia February 3, 2012</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prussian_carp&amp;oldid=474152840\">Wikipedia January 31 2012</a>)\r\n","agents":[{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Dana Campbell","homepage":"","role":"provider"}],"references":["Komiyama, T.,  H.

Goldfish lay eggs on submerged vegetation.  Females spawn multiple times during the spawning period (Ref. 88808).  Oviparous, with pelagic larvae.  They last long in captivity (Ref. 7248).
