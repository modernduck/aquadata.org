we strongly recommend keeping it in a\u00a0tank\u00a0designed to simulate a flowing stream with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel, and some water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc., arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots, thus providing broken lines of sight.","While the majority of aquatic plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as Microsorum, Bolbitis, or Anubias spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive, thus weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should also be considered routine.","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and some water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0meaning power\u00a0filter(s), additional\u00a0powerhead(s), or airstone(s) should be employed as necessary."],"diet":["Rhinogobius\u00a0spp. tend to be opportunistic carnivores feeding on a range of small invertebrates, crustaceans and similar in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they should be offered small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0chironomid\u00a0(bloodworm) or mosquito\u00a0larvae,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Mysis, etc.","Dried foods may be accepted following a period of\u00a0acclimatisation\u00a0but should not be used regularly."],"behaviour":["This is a robust species and can be aggressive at times but it can be kept in a\u00a0community\u00a0provided tankmates are chosen with care.","Peaceful, pelagic species which inhabit similar environments in nature such as Tanichthys or Danio species are perhaps the best choices for the upper levels, but we\u2019ve also seen Rhinogobius spp. being maintained alongside barbs, small characins, poeciliid livebearers, etc.","Less suitable are\u00a0freshwater\u00a0shrimp from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Caridina\u00a0and\u00a0Neocaridina\u00a0as these are likely to be predated upon.","Balitorid and nemacheilid loaches may prove suitable in larger tanks but in smaller set-ups R. candidianus should ideally be the only benthic species included.","It should not be mixed with congeners, especially closely-related ones such as R. nantaiensis,\u00a0since it\u2019s not yet clear if they\u2019re capable of hybridisation.","Larger fishes are best omitted although in very large set-ups it may be possible to add a few non-predatory, surface-dwelling ones, while the majority of cichlids and other\u00a0territorial\u00a0fishes inhabiting the lower reaches should be avoided entirely.","While males are territorial with one another to an extent serious damage is unlikely provided the tank contains sufficient cover, and in fact they appear to actively require the presence of conspecifics.","Aim to purchase at least two males and as many or more females or the fish may become listless and inactive."],"reproduction":["As is typical for the genus eggs are deposited on the ceiling of a cave or crevice and guarded by the male until hatching.","Several potential\u00a0sites should be offered in the form of rocks (flat slate tends to be easiest to handle, see below), terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc.","A nuptial male will select a site and defend it against other males, but if \u00a0one is not available may excavate a cave beneath a rock or other piece of d\u00e9cor.","Spawning occurs secretively within the cave, and is\u00a0usually signified by the pair disappearing from sight for an extended period of time.","They may remain inside for 2-3 days with the female ejected once spawning is complete, and should not be disturbed during this period.","Once the female is seen outside the cave, you can check for eggs by carefully lifting and tilting it without removing from the water.","Inexperienced pairs or males may eat the eggs, attach them poorly, or only partially fertilise them, but after a few attempts normally get things right.","At this point it\u2019s advisable to remove all other fish except the male, or remove male and eggs elsewhere ( a small plastic container can be used to do so without harming either).","Brood size is normally between 20-100 depending on the age and experience of the fish and the eggs are relatively large as with other\u00a0fluvial\u00a0members of the genus.","Incubation is normally 9-11 days days, and the fry undergo an initial pelagic stage during which they live and feed up in the water column before dropping to the substrate.","They can be offered\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, microworm, and suchlike immediately."],"create_time":1426713679.70896}
