It is now only found in Katchanaburi, Thailand. The species is not found downstream of dams on the Mae Klong, nor in the Khao Laem reservoir, and it is restricted to the parts of streams above reservoirs. The current area of occupancy (AOO) for this fish is estimated at much less than 100 km\u00b2, based on two known remaining streams where the species is thought to be still present. The species is assessed as Endangered on the basis of the restricted AOO and two assumed locations. The remaining populations are impacted by habitat loss. Further research is needed to confirm the species inferred distribution, and it should be reassessed if further distribution information becomes available; if it is discovered to be much more widespread than currently known then it should be reassessed.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Ng, H.H., Kullander, S.O., Rainboth, W., Kottelat, M. & Allen, D.J."}]
