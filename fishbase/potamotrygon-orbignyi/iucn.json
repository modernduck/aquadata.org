It has a low fecundity, and exhibits geographical variation in biological parameters. The species is taken as food and juveniles enter the ornamental fish trade although it is not highly sought after. In some areas, its habitat is threatened by illegal mining activities. Furthermore, it is persecuted in tourist areas and also targeted in sports fisheries. It is assessed as Least Concern due to its wide distribution and abundance, but a number of conservation measures (which would also benefit other potamotrygonid species) are recommended to ensure that its populations remain viable. These include the development of research and monitoring programs, legislation to regulate the ornamental and sports fisheries, protection of nursery areas and public education to reduce persecution.","assessor":"G\u00f3es de Ara\u00fajo, M.L., Pinto de Almeida, M., Rinc\u00f3n, G., Charvet-Almeida, P. & Rosa, R.S.","evaluator":"Kyne, P.M., Cavanagh, R.D. & Fowler, S.L.
