date known only from the Ben Hai river system in north central Vietnam which flows chiefly through the province of Quang Tri.","The type specimens were collected from neighbouring Quang Binh province with the locality given as \u2018Stream Bau Dung, a tributary of River Ben Hai, 17\u00b007\u201924\u2033N, 106\u00b058\u201912\u2033E, Quang Binh Province, Vietnam\u2019."],"habitat":["The type locality was a fast-flowing, shallow stream with sandy substrate and measured around 15 metres across.","The water was clear and T. micagemmae collected only in marginal areas where the flow was considerably reduced.","The majority of the Bau Dung drainage is heavily exploited for rice cultivation, but this particular stream is not as it flows through sand dunes a few kilometers from the coast.","Sympatric fishes included Microcobitis misgurnoides, Yunnanilus cruciatus, Macropodus opercularis,\u00a0and an unidentified species of Odontobutis."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not especially critical though it tends to show better colouration in a heavily-planted set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The addition of some floating plants, driftwood roots or branches, and leaf litter\u00a0also seems to be appreciated and adds a more natural feel.","Filtration does not need to be particularly strong though it does seem to appreciate a degree of water movement and will also do well in a hill stream-type set-up."],"diet":["Likely to be a micropredator feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans, and other zooplankton in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0alongside good quality dried flakes and granules, at least some of which should include additional plant or algal content."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful indeed and an ideal resident of the well-maintained community tank although it will not do well with much larger or more boisterous tankmates.","Since it has no special demands in terms of water chemistry it can be combined with many of the most popular fish in the hobby including other small cyprinids as well as tetras, livebearers, dwarf cichlids, catfishes, and loaches.","In a stream-style tank\u00a0it can be kept with the smaller species of Danio, Devario, and Garra as well as many loaches.","It\u2019s a\u00a0schooling\u00a0fish by nature and ideally a group comprising 10+ specimens should be purchased.","Maintaining such numbers will not only make individuals less nervous but result in a more effective, natural-looking display while males will also display their best colours as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["Like many small cyprinids this\u00a0species\u00a0is an\u00a0egg-scattering, continuous spawner that exhibits no\u00a0parental care.","That is to say when the fish are in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and when a group is maintained alone in a densely-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0or outdoor container small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0usually start to appear without further intervention.","Should a more controlled approach be required a separate, smaller aquarium\u00a0can be set up.","This should be dimly-lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.","The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced, and\u00a0spawning\u00a0should take place the following morning.","An alternative is to spawn the fish in a group with half a dozen specimens of each\u00a0sex\u00a0being a good number, although a larger aquarium may be necessary.","In either situation the adults will probably eat the eggs given the chance and should be removed after 2-3 days maximum.","The eggs should hatch in 48-72 hours and once free-swimming the\u00a0fry\u00a0may initially require\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or other microscopic food until large enough to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0and suchlike."],"create_time":1426713994.57004}
