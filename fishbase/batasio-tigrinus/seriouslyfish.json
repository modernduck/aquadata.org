The Khwae Noi is part of the larger Mae Klong watershed, merging with the Khwae Yai at the town of Kanchanaburi.","habitat":["Batasio spp. are obligate inhabitants of headwater streams and the upper reaches of smaller rivers characterised by\u00a0shallow, fast-flowing, highly-oxygenated stretches of riffles and runs broken up by pools or cascades in some cases.","Substrates are normally composed of smaller rocks,\u00a0sand\u00a0and\u00a0gravel\u00a0with jumbles of boulders or exposed bedrock, and while\u00a0riparian/stream-side vegetation and patches of submerged leaf litter are common features\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants aren\u2019t usually present.\u00a0During periods of high rainfall some such streams may become temporarily\u00a0turbid\u00a0due to suspended material dislodged by increased (sometimes torrential) flow rate and water depth."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions but largely unsuitable for the \u2018general\u2019\u00a0community aquarium. We recommend keeping it in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0gravel\u00a0and some large water-worn boulders. This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, roots and tough aquatic plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp., which can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Like many\u00a0species\u00a0that naturally inhabit running waters it\u2019s intolerant to the accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water at all times in order to thrive. It\u2019s also essential to provide sufficient levels of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and water movement using a combination of canister filters, powerheads, etc., particularly if the aim is for the fish to breed. Weekly water changes of 30-50% should also be considered mandatory."],"diet":"Likely to feed \u00a0small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton in nature, and the captive diet should therefore comprise largely of small live and/or frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), Tubifex, Artemia, mosquito larvae, etc. Some success has also been had using prepared, sinking foods though newly-imported wild specimens may refuse them initially.","behaviour":["Not especially competitive and should not be kept with much larger or more aggressive fishes. Suitably-sized, peaceful, schooling\u00a0cyprinids are ideal, or if geography isn\u2019t an issue many characids and livebearers should also work. Akysid or sisorid catfishes from genera such as\u00a0Erithistes,\u00a0Erethistoides,\u00a0Hara,\u00a0Pseudolaguvia\u00a0and many\u00a0Glyptothorax\u00a0spp. are recommended for the lower levels.","In addition, balitorid loaches from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Gastromyzon,\u00a0Pseudogastromyzon\u00a0and\u00a0Homaloptera\u00a0are suitable, and some members of the families Cobitidae and Nemacheilidae should also be ok but proper research is essential as some can be excessively aggressive/territorial\u00a0or simply grow too large."],"reproduction":"Success has been achieved with at least two other members of the genus. Spawning can apparently be triggered by performing one or more large, 50-70%, water changes with cool water once the fish appear to be in spawning condition. The eggs are scattered randomly and take approximately 2 days to hatch.","create_time":1426710527.24079}
