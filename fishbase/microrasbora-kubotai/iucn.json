It inhabits streams with moderate flow and submereged vegetation, which is used for spawning. The native population in Thailand is declining due to the impacts of habitat modification caused by conversion into rubber  and palm oil plantations and water extraction for irrigation, but there is no information on the population in Myanmar. This species is  regularly collected for the international aquarium fish trade; the  harvest in Thailand presently seems sustainable and less than it was in  the 1990's. This species is assessed as Least Concern, based on the assumption that this species does occur continuously between the two confirmed locations and there are no threats in Myanmar (which would contain the greatest proportion of this species EOO). There is however some concern about the populations in Thailand.","assessor":"Kottelat, M.","evaluator":"Smith, K. & Allen, D."}]
