The water these contain is typically stained dark brown with humic acids and other chemicals released by decaying organic material. This results in a negligible dissolved mineral content, and the pH can drop as low as 4.0 or 5.0. The dense rainforest canopy above means that very little light penetrates the water surface, and the substrate is normally littered with fallen tree branches and a deep layer of rotting leaves.","maintenance":["Provided adequate cover and structure is available this\u00a0species\u00a0is unfussy with regards to d\u00e9cor with ceramic flowerpots, lengths of plastic piping and other artificial materials all useful additions. A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it bring the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst most populations will appreciate the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks. If maintaining a\u00a0blackwater\u00a0population\u00a0a net bag filled with\u00a0aquarium-safe\u00a0peat\u00a0can also be added to the\u00a0filter\u00a0or suspended over the edge of the\u00a0tank.","Fairly dim lighting is recommended and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0andAnubias\u00a0are best since they will grow under such conditions. A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective. Filtration, or at least water flow, should not be very strong and very large water changes are best avoided with 10-15% weekly adequate provided the\u00a0tank\u00a0is lightly-stocked."],"diet":"Primarily\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0and apparently feeds mostly on\u00a0benthic\u00a0invertebrates in nature. In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0live and frozen foods such as\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0Daphnia\u00a0and\u00a0chironomid\u00a0larvae\u00a0(bloodworm) should be offered regularly although most specimens will also learn to accept dried alternatives with pelleted products generally preferred to flake.","behaviour":"Captive-raised fish are the recommended choice for the\u00a0community aquarium. Wild examples are best maintained alone or with small \u2018dither\u2019 fishes such as\u00a0Nannostomus\u00a0spp., and ideally should not be mixed with other\u00a0Apistogramma.","reproduction":"Substrate\u00a0spawner which normally lays its eggs in crevices or cavities among the d\u00e9cor. The female is responsible for post-spawning\u00a0care of eggs and\u00a0fry\u00a0and in smaller aquaria the male may need to be removed as she may become hyper-aggressive.","create_time":1426710229.89545}
