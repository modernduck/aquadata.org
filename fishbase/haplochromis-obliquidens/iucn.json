The biggest threat to this species is increased hybridisation as a result of decreased water transparency. It is not known to what extent this is affecting different areas of the lake, but its current distribution is likely restricted to only a few locations, and it is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.","assessor":"Witte, F., de Zeeuw, M.P. & Brooks, E.","evaluator":"Darwall, W. & Smith, K."}]
