Area of occupancy (AOO) is uncertain but may be less than 2000 sq km. Extent of occurrence, number of locations, and population size currently exceed the thresholds for supporting the Vulnerable category, but the species nevertheless nearly qualifies for Vulnerable on the basis of small AOO and continuing decline.","assessor":"NatureServe","evaluator":"Smith, K. & Darwall, W.R.T."}]
