Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","The water should be well-oxygenated with a little surface agitation advisable.","Do not add this fish to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0as it can be susceptible to swings in water chemistry."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature, especially at the water surface.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc.","Small insects such as crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use although it\u2019s best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish."],"behaviour":["Peaceful but somewhat unsuitable for the general\u00a0community\u00a0aquarium.","It\u2019s perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and diminutive, non-predatory cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle.","Males will also display their best colours and some fascinating behaviour as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["Displays an interesting reproductive strategy in which spawning and egg deposition occurs on overhanging vegetation above the water surface.","In a\u00a0mature\u00a0set-up\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention but should you wish\u00a0to maximise yield a more controlled approach using a separate tank is preferable.","This can be arranged very simply with an air-powered sponge filter, plenty of floating plants and a gap of around 10 cm between water surface and cover.","You can also use emerse vegetation if you wish although the fish aren\u2019t fussy and will depoit their eggs on almost\u00a0any suitable surface, including the side of the aquarium or cover glass.","The\u00a0site is selected by the male and he may be seen repeatedly leaping out of the water as he searches for a suitable spot.","Once a site has been chosen the male attempts to attract females in the vicinity and at the climax of courtship\u00a0the pair\u00a0jump out of the water and cling onto the spawning site using their pelvic fins.","They may remain in place for up to 10 seconds or so as eggs and milt are released.","10-12 eggs are typically deposited during a single event and the process\u00a0is repeated until the female is spent with total\u00a0brood size normally 100-200.","The female now plays no further part in broodcare\u00a0and can be removed but the male remains in the vicinity and keeps the eggs moist by using his caudal-fin to splash water at them, this behaviour ceasing during the hours of darkness.","On occasion a pair\u00a0will deposit eggs in several places or a single male may spawn with several females and thus must maintain several batches of eggs simultaneously.","The splashing is repeated every minute or so and\u00a0continues for the next 36-72 hours until the eggs hatch at which point the fry simply drop into the water.","At this point paternal care ceases and adults or fry are best moved elsewhere in order to avoid predation.","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them.","As with other\u00a0Copella\u00a0spp. growth is very slow."],"create_time":1426711075.56217}
