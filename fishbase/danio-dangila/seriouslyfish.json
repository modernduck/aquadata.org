In the aquarium it\u2019s a largely unfussy feeder and will accept most foods.","A good quality dried product can be used as the staple diet but this should be supplemented with regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm), Daphnia, Artemia, etc., for the best colouration and conditioning."],"behaviour":["Not an aggressive fish but may upset very slow-moving or timid tankmates with its constant activity and vigorous feeding behaviour so can only be considered appropriate for larger tanks containing robust, similarly-sized fishes.","There are plenty of suitable choices including many cyprinids, loaches, cichlids, catfishes and characins although as always when selecting a compatible community of fish proper research is essential.","A community based around one of its native countries or river basins would also make a worthwhile project with some interesting alternatives (see \u2018Habitat\u2019).","It\u2019s a schooling species by nature and ideally should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens.","Maintaining it in decent numbers will not only make the fish less prone to bouts of skittishness but will result in a more effective, natural looking display while any aggressive behaviour will normally be contained as the fish concentrate on maintaining their hierarchical position within the group."],"reproduction":["Like many cyprinids this species is an egg-scatterer that exhibits no parental care.","If\u00a0the fish are in good condition they should\u00a0spawn often, and in a densely-planted, mature aquarium it\u2019s possible that small numbers of fry may start to appear without intervention.","In general, however, D. devario\u00a0has proven tricker than other danios with the usual methods tending not to yield results.","When only a single pair is used the larger females tends to chase the male incessantly, for example, and the only successful report we know of is that of U.S. aquarist Dennis Ball whose group of 8 adult fish of the Meghalaya population spawned during a thunder storm following a period of being conditioned with live foods.","Although a clump of Taxiphylum was present in the aquarium the fish chose to spawn within the coarse gravel substrate with the females leading and males behind.","Once spawning had ended the adults were removed.","The first fry were observed approximately 48 hours after the spawning event and became free-swimming after a further 48 hours.","From this point onwards they\u00a0were offered Artemia nauplii and branded fry foods, and grew very quickly reaching 12-15 mm within 30 days.","Thanks to Dennis Ball."],"create_time":1426711500.62431}
