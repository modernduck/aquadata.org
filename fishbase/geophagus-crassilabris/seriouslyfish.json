locality is \u2018Isthmus of Panama near Candelaria\u2019 and this species is endemic to the\u00a0Pacific and Atlantic slopes of central and eastern Panama.","Known localities include the r\u00edos Baud\u00f3, Chagres, Cupe, Missimbi, Platenal, Frijoles, Bayano, Ipeti, Sucubti, Sabalo, Pirra, Pep\u00e9, Samb\u00fa, Morti, Uruseca, Meteti and Tuira."],"habitat":"Inhabits pristine steams and rivers with moderate water flow and substrates of sand or gravel, with submerged woody structures such as driftwood or tree roots also common features.","maintenance":["The most essential item of d\u00e9cor is a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0so that the fish can browse naturally (see \u2018Diet\u2019).","Coarser materials such as\u00a0gravel\u00a0or small pebbles can inhibit feeding, damage\u00a0gill\u00a0filaments and even be ingested with the potential of internal damage or blockages.","Additional furnishings are as much a case of personal taste as anything else but the most favoured set-ups tend to feature relatively dim lighting plus some chunks of driftwood and scattered roots or branches.","Leaf litter is a typical feature of the natural environment but not really recommended in aquaria because the feeding behaviour of\u00a0Geophagus\u00a0spp. tends to cause an excess of partially-decomposed material in suspension which not only looks unsightly but can block\u00a0filter\u00a0and\u00a0pump mechanisms.","One or two flattish, water-worn rocks can also be included to provide potential\u00a0spawning\u00a0sites if you wish.","Water quality is of the utmost importance since these cichlids are extremely susceptible to deteriorating water quality and swings in chemical parameters so should never be introduced to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium.","The best way to achieve the desired stability is to over-filter\u00a0the\u00a0tank\u00a0using a combination of external canister filters and/or a\u00a0sump\u00a0system and perform minimum weekly water changes of 50-70%.","If the maintenance regime is insufficient health issues such as\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or\u00a0stunted\u00a0growth can occur.","Mechanical filtration\u00a0should also be tailored to trap small particles stirred up by the fish as\u00a0sand\u00a0can cause blockages and wearing issues with\u00a0filter\u00a0mechanisms if allowed to continually run through the system.","High flow rates should be avoided so position\u00a0filter\u00a0returns accordingly."],"diet":["\u2018Geophagus\u2018\u00a0steindachneri\u00a0group spp. are\u00a0benthophagous\u00a0by nature and mostly employ a feeding strategy whereby mouthfuls of\u00a0substrate\u00a0are taken and sifted for edible items with the remaining material expelled via the gills and mouth.","For this reason they\u2019re commonly termed \u2018eartheaters\u2019 and the provision of a suitable\u00a0substrate\u00a0is essential to their long-term well-being.","Once settled they readily rise into the\u00a0water column\u00a0when food is introduced but continue to browse normally at other times.","The stomach contents of wild specimens mostly comprise small\u00a0aquatic\u00a0and terrestrial invertebrates, plant material in the form of seeds,\u00a0organic\u00a0detritus\u00a0and sediment.","Even as adults these cichlids seem unable to properly ingest larger food items meaning the diet should contain a variety of high quality, fine-grade prepared foods plus small live or frozen bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, mosquito\u00a0larvae, etc.","At least some of the dried products should contain a high proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife.","Rather than a single large meal offer 3-4 smaller portions daily to allow natural browsing behaviour as this seems to result in the best growth rate and condition."],"behaviour":["Adult males are typically aggressive towards one another, especially when courting or\u00a0spawning\u00a0and only one should be housed in all but the largest aquaria.","This\u00a0species\u00a0cannot be described as\u00a0predatory\u00a0but very small tankmates may nevertheless be eaten.","This species apparently practices polygyny meaning a single male should ideally be provided with a group of 2 or more females."],"reproduction":["Ovophilous, maternal mouthbrooder forming weak\u00a0pair\u00a0bonds during the\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0only.","Most breeders recommend isolating holding females as they\u2019re often subject to harassment from conspecifics."],"create_time":1426711801.09402}
