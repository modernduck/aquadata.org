Organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","Following a protracted courtship, eggs and milt are released during an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of anabantoids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female.","Several \u2018dummy\u2019 embraces may be required before spawning commences.","Fertilised eggs are caught on the anal fin of the male then picked up in the mouth of the female before being spat out into the water for the male to catch.","Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth the cycle is repeated untill the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0which can take some time.","Brood size is quite small, with even 10 eggs being considered a good number.","A brooding male may swallow or release the\u00a0eggs\u00a0prematurely if stressed or inexperienced, so it\u2019s preferable to leave the female and any other fishes in situ.","The incubation period is 10 \u2013 21 days at the end of which the male will begin to release fully-formed, free-swimming\u00a0fry.","At this point they can be removed or left to be reared alongside the adults, which will not normally harm them.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones."],"create_time":1426710586.24713}
