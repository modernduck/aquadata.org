More recently a population has been discovered on the nearby island of Phu Quoc, Vietnam.","The colour of the fish can vary depending on the locality; for example specimens from Krabi province, south Thailand have a more intense reddish colouration than those from Chanthaburi province in the east."],"habitat":["Varies with locality. It most commonly inhabits gently flowing sections of forest streams and tributaries where submerged aquatic plants grow thickly. The water is sometimes stained faintly brown/yellow due to the presence of tannins and other chemicals released by decomposing organic matter and the substrate scattered with fallen leaves, twigs and branches.","Such environments characteristically contain soft, weakly acidic to neutral water and are often dimly-lit due to dense marginal vegetation and the forest canopy above.","In Krabi province, southern Thailand it can be found living in a particular karstic (limestone) area with neutral to alkaline water (pH 7.0-7.4). The habitat consists of a series of deep limestone sinkholes forming pools at the surface, plus a small ditch which acts as an overflow from the pools.","The water is very clear and is tinted a bright blue/green colour due to reflection of light from the high levels of calcium carbonate it contains. These ponds are also significant because they represent the only known locality where Betta simplex can be found."],"maintenance":["Choice of decor is not especially critical although it tends to show better colouration when maintained in a well-furnished set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate, and it\u2019s a relatively popular choice for carefully-aquascaped arrangements.","A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots and branches placed such a way that plenty of shady spots and caves are formed.","The addition of dried leaf litter (beech, oak or Ketapang almond leaves are all suitable) would further emphasise the natural feel and with it the growth of beneficial microbe colonies as\u00a0decomposition\u00a0occurs. These can provide a valuable secondary food source for\u00a0fry, whilst the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves will aid in simulating a\u00a0blackwater\u00a0environment. Leaves can be left in the\u00a0tank\u00a0to break down fully or removed and replaced every few weeks.","This\u00a0species\u00a0seems to do best under fairly dim lighting and plant\u00a0species\u00a0from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0are recommended since they will grow under such conditions. A few patches of floating vegetation to diffuse the light even further may also prove effective."],"diet":"Probably\u00a0\u00a0a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on small insects, worms, crustaceans, and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.\u00a0In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia, alongside good quality dried flakes and granules.","behaviour":["This\u00a0species\u00a0is very peaceful indeed making it an ideal resident of the well-maintained\u00a0community\u00a0tank. As it places no extreme demands in terms of water chemistry it can be combined with many of the most popular fish in the hobby including other small cyprinids as well as tetras, livebearers, dwarf cichlids, catfishes, and loaches. As always when selecting a compatible\u00a0community\u00a0of fish thorough research is essential and its small adult size must be a consideration, however.","It\u2019s a\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0by nature and really should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens. Maintaining it in decent numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but will result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Males will also display their best colours as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":["This\u00a0species\u00a0exhibits no\u00a0parental care\u00a0although it does utilise a different\u00a0spawning\u00a0method to most small cyprinids as the eggs are attached to the underside of broad plant leaves or other objects rather than scattered randomly. When the fish are in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a densely-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of young may start to appear without human intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of\u00a0fry\u00a0a slightly more controlled approach is required. The adult group can still be conditioned together but a separate tank should also be set up. This should be very dimly lit with the\u00a0base\u00a0either left bare or covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that any eggs that fail to adhere to the plant can pass through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works very well.","The water itself should ideally be of\u00a0pH\u00a05.0-6.0, 1-5\u00b0H with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. A decent-sized clump of\u00a0Microsorium,\u00a0Cryptocoryne, other broad-leaved plant or artificial alternative should also be included. Filtration is not really necessary but you can use a small, air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0if you prefer.","Some breeders of other\u00a0Trigonostigma\u00a0spp. report that older fish aged a year or more make the best subjects for\u00a0spawning\u00a0which may be the reason why this\u00a0species\u00a0is often said to be difficult to breed. Apparently it is trickier to initiate\u00a0spawning\u00a0behaviour in younger individuals and they are also are less\u00a0fecund.","At any rate the best way to condition them is by feeding small amounts of live and frozen foods 2 or 3 times a day in the weeks leading up to a\u00a0spawning\u00a0attempt. When the females appear full of eggs and the males are showing their best colours as they display to one another a large (40-50% of\u00a0tank\u00a0volume), cool water change should be performed and one or two pairs introduced to each\u00a0spawning\u00a0container a few hours later, preferably in the evening.","Spawning\u00a0usually occurs in the morning hours and is preceded by a flurry of\u00a0courtship\u00a0activity by the male(s). Often a\u00a0pair\u00a0will perform a number of \u2018dry runs\u2019 over a chosen\u00a0spawning\u00a0surface and it may be several hours before any eggs are produced.","Eventually the female will begin to lay small batches of eggs which are fertilised by the male before the next batch is laid. The\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0is particularly interesting as often a female will choose the underside of a plant leaf and thus the\u00a0pair\u00a0will be observed in an inverted position as eggs and sperm are released.","If the\u00a0pair(s) fail to\u00a0spawn\u00a0immediately they can be left\u00a0in situ\u00a0but if no eggs have been observed after 3 or 4 days they should be returned to the main group and a different set of fish chosen. There is no need to feed the adults while they are in the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank.","Post-spawning\u00a0the adults will eat any eggs they find so either they or the eggs themselves should be removed as soon as possible. Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but usually takes between 24 and 48 hours with the young free-swimming in around a week. Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or similar introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0and/or\u00a0microworm\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426714133.52241}
