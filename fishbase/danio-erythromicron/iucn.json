It is assessed as Endangered on  the basis of a single location (major threat of introduced predators),  restricted extent of occurrence and area of occupancy, and declining habitat quality and population size as a  result of the impacts of introduced species, suspected over-harvesting  for the aquarium trade, and the impacts of pollution. The area of open water in the lake has declined in recent years (Sidle <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2007), a situation that has been exacerbated by recent draughts (Htwe 2010).
