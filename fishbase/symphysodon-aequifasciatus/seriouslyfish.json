A breeding pair should have plenty of space both horizontally and vertically, so a tank around 48\u2033 x 18\u2033 x 18\u2033 (120cm x 45cm x 45cm) \u2013 255 litres is recommended for a few juvenile fish or a pair of breeding adults.","Aquarium SizeTop \u2191","The maximum size reported for wild Discus is around 14cm (6\u2033). It is however claimed that Discus can actually reach 9\u2033 in aquaria through a stringent regime of frequent, large water changes during the most important growth periods.
