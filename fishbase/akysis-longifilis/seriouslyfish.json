We\u2019ve been unable to establish any firm details regarding additional localities to date but the species\u2018 appearance in the aquarium trade suggests it may have a wider distribution within the Sittaung drainage.","A. portellus also occurs in the Sittaung with its type locality just 90 km downstream from that of A. longifilis."],"habitat":["Members of this genus are near-exclusive inhabitants of swiftly-flowing streams and rivers with substrates generally consisting of any combination of sand, gravel and rocks. Water is normally transparent to slightly turbid, though overall volume, flow, and thus the amount of suspended material tend to increase significantly during rainy periods.","Aquatic plants are not normally present though there may be patches of leaf litter or underwater structures such as fallen branches or roots protruding from banks."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep but should really be provided with a soft, sandy substrate since some of its time is spent completely buried, or with only eyes protruding. It also appears to enjoy squeezing into crevices between rockwork and other solid surfaces so additional d\u00e9cor could include some water-worn rocks of various sizes, plus perhaps some driftwood roots and branches.","Although aquatic plants are unlikely to be a feature of its natural habitat some can be added if you wish with those that can be grown attached to rocks and wood, such as Microsorum, Anubias or various moss species particularly useful since they will not be disturbed by the fishes\u2019 burrowing activity. Leaf litter can also be used.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of organic pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive. It also does best if there is a relatively high proportion of dissolved oxygen and decent water movement in the tank. Weekly water changes of 30-50% tank volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Akysis species are primarily nocturnal micropredators feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton. They can be a little picky in the aquarium and may not accept dried foods although in some cases they will learn to take them over time.","At any rate they should always be offered regular meals of small live or frozen fare such as Artemia, Daphnia, bloodworm or glassworm, ideally after dark in order that they can demonstrate natural behaviour, though once settled most specimens will emerge at feeding times. If the specimens are very small you may need to chop the food accordingly."],"behaviour":["Not especially competitive and should not be kept with much larger or more aggressive fishes. Miniature schooling cyprinids such as Boraras, Microdevario or smaller Danio/Rasbora species make good tankmates and if geography isn\u2019t an issue many similarly-sized characins and livebearers should also work.","Other similarly-sized akysid catfishes plus smaller sisorids such as Erithistes, Erethistoides, Hara, Pseudolaguvia and many Glyptothorax spp. are recommended for the lower levels.","In addition, many balitorid loaches from genera such as Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon and Homaloptera are also suitable. Some members of the families Botiidae, Cobitidae and Nemacheilidae are ok but proper research is essential as some can be excessively aggressive/territorial or simply grow too large, and it\u2019s also proven to co-exist peacefully with freshwater shrimp.","It\u2019s nonaggressive towards conspecifics and can be kept singly or in a group as preferred."],"reproduction":["Unreported, though a short report was published in the description of A. vespa (Ng and Kottelat, 2004), in which a successful spawning event in that species was apparently triggered by a significant decrease in temperature of around 44.6\u00b0F/7\u00b0C.","Several males were observed in pursuit of a gravid female, and the successful individual was allowed to wrap its body around that of the female at which point eggs and milt were released. The eggs hatched 4 days post-spawn with the yolk sac fully-absorbed after 10 days. Adult patterning was fully-developed after just 23 days."],"create_time":1426709972.19109}
