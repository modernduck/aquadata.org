It often inhabits riffles and runs and is likely to show a preference for shallower zones.","Substrates are generally composed of gravel, rocks, boulders or bedrock carpeted with a rich biofilm formed by algae and other micro-organisms. Patches of aquatic plants are only occasionally present but riparian\u00a0vegetation is usually well-developed.","At one locality in the Sungai Rajang basin it was observed in a riffle alongside a number of other species including Hampala macrolepidota, Paracrossocheilus vittata, \u2018Puntius\u2018 banksi, P. kuchingensis, Rasbora dusonensis, Gastromyzon megalepis, G. punctulatus, Nemacheilus saravacensis, Glyptothorax major, Hemirhamphodon kuekenthali, Dorichthys martensii, Channa lucius, Auriglobus silus, two species of Macrognathus, plus unidentified members\u00a0of Homaloptera and Neogastromyzon."],"maintenance":["Most importantly the water must be clean and well-oxygenated so we suggest the use of an over-sized\u00a0filter\u00a0as a minimum requirement. Turnover should ideally be 10-15 times per hour so additional powerheads, airstones, etc., should be employed as necessary to achieve the desired flow and\u00a0oxygenation.","Base\u00a0substrate\u00a0can either be of\u00a0gravel,\u00a0sand\u00a0or a mixture of both to which should be added a layer of water-worn rocks and pebbles of varying sizes.","Driftwood roots and branches are also suitable and although rarely a feature of the natural habitat aquatic plants from adaptable genera such as Microsorum, Crinum and Anubias spp. can also be added. The latter are particularly useful as Homaloptera spp. appear to enjoy resting on their leaves.","Since it needs stable water conditions and feeds on\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass. While regular partial water changes are essential\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0can be allowed to grow on all surfaces except perhaps the viewing pane."],"diet":["Homaloptera\u00a0spp. are specialised grazers feeding on\u00a0biofilm, small crustaceans, insect\u00a0larvae\u00a0and other invertebrates.","In captivity some sinking dried foods may be accepted but regular meals of live or frozen\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, etc., are essential for the maintenance of good health, and it\u2019s highly preferable if the\u00a0tank\u00a0contains rock and other solid surfaces with growths of\u00a0algae\u00a0and other\u00a0aufwuchs.","Balitorids are often seen on sale in an emaciated state which can be difficult to correct. A good dealer will have done something about this prior to sale but if you decide to take a chance with severely weakened specimens they\u2019ll initially require a continual, easily-obtainable source of suitable foods in the absence of competitors if they\u2019re to recover."],"behaviour":["Not an aggressive fish although its particular requirements limit the choice of suitable tankmates.","Species\u00a0inhabiting similar environments include\u00a0Barilius,\u00a0Discherodontus,\u00a0Garra, Devario, some\u00a0Rasbora, gobies of the\u00a0genera\u00a0Rhinogobius,\u00a0Sicyopterus\u00a0and\u00a0Stiphodon\u00a0plus\u00a0Glyptothorax,\u00a0Akysis\u00a0and\u00a0Oreoglanis\u00a0spp. catfishes.","Many loaches from the\u00a0family\u00a0Nemacheilidae and most from Balitoridae are also suitable although harmless squabbles may occur with the latter group in particular. Research your choices before purchase to be sure.","It\u2019s found living in aggregations in nature so buy six or more to see it at its best as when kept singly or smaller groups it tends to be less bold. The interaction between individuals is also interesting to watch and a group will typically arrange themselves close to one another facing directly into the water flow at certain times of day."],"reproduction":"Presumably a seasonal spawner in nature but nothing has been recorded in aquaria.","create_time":1426712051.58354}
