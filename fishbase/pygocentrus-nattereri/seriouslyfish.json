Sexual maturity is reached at around a year of age and 10-15 cm in length. Unless you can find a sexed pair start with 6+ and allow a pair or two to form naturally. In some cases spawning has been initiated by large, cool water changes whereas in others it occurred without intervention.","As males come into sexual condition they become isolated from the rest of the group and excavate a patch of substrate using the mouth and caudal-fin. Aquatic plants may also be cropped if present and the resultant \u2018nest\u2019 is defended against other males.","Receptive females demonstrate interest by mouthing the substrate around the nest, and when ready to spawn both male and female darken in body colour. Eggs and spawn are deposited in several batches and guarded by the male, sometimes assisted by the female. In large aquaria multiple pairs may spawn simultaneously.","The eggs hatch in 2-3 days with fry free-swimming by the fifth. At this point it\u2019s best to siphon them into smaller sponge-filtered set-ups.\u00a0Several meals of Artemia nauplii/microworm and water changes of ~10% tank volume are required daily.","The fry become increasingly cannibalistic as they grow so should be moved to progressively larger aquaria in batches of similar size. Think carefully before taking on such a project, however, as you could end up with 1000+ young piranhas with very little sell-on value."],"create_time":1426713612.10918}
