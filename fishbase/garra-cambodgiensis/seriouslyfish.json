This appears to correspond to the area of the same name in Kamphong Spue province, western Cambodia, which lies within the lower Mekong River basin."],"habitat":["Tends to inhabit swiftly-flowing sections of headwaters and tributaries rather than larger, lowland\u00a0river channels.\u00a0The most favourable habitats contain clear, oxygen-saturated water which, allied with the sun, facilitates the development of a rich\u00a0biofilm\u00a0carpeting submerged surfaces. During periods of high rainfall some streams may be temporarily\u00a0turbid\u00a0due to suspended material dislodged by increased (sometimes torrential) flow rate and water depth.","In the Taeng\u00a0river, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, it was collected in a stream modified by irrigation work alongside Nemacheilus binotatus,\u00a0Schistura geisleri,\u00a0S. desmotes,\u00a0Tuberoschistura baenzigeri,\u00a0Homalopteroides smithi,\u00a0H. sexmaculata,\u00a0Lepidocephalichthys hasselti,\u00a0Acantopsis\u00a0sp.,\u00a0Acanthopsoides gracilis,\u00a0Pangio anguillaris,\u00a0Systomus orphoides,\u00a0Mystacoleucus obtusirostris, Opsarius\u00a0koratensis,\u00a0Rasbora aurotaenia, Glyptothorax laosensis,\u00a0G. lampris,\u00a0Trichopodus trichopterus,\u00a0Trichopsis vittata\u00a0and\u00a0Dermogenys pusillus."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep in a well-maintained set-up, but a display arranged\u00a0to resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river,\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized, water-worn rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0and perhaps some small boulders, is highly recommended. This can be further furnished with driftwood roots or branches, and hardy\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp., which can be grown attached to items of d\u00e9cor.","Most importantly, the water must be clean and well-oxygenated with turnover preferably\u00a0in excess of 10 times per hour; additional powerheads and airstones can be employed to achieve the desired flow and\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0if necessary. Bright lighting will promote development\u00a0of\u00a0biofilm\u00a0on solid surfaces, upon which the fish will\u00a0graze.","Since it needs stable water conditions and grazes\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass."],"diet":["Although it will\u00a0graze\u00a0algae\u00a0if available this\u00a0species\u00a0is not an exclusive\u00a0herbivore. Offer meaty foods such as live or frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, chopped prawn, etc., along with good quality, sinking dried products, at least some of which should contain a significant proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach or courgette can be offered occasionally and home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, are also proven to work well."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful and makes a good subject for the well-chosen, larger community of stream-dwelling Indochinese species.","It isn\u2019t particularly tolerant of conspecifics but apparently exists in loose aggregations in the wild. If kept singly it tends to behave more aggressively with similarly-shaped fishes so we recommend the purchase of 3-4 or more should space permit. Such a group will develop a noticeable\u00a0pecking order\u00a0between themselves but tankmates are more likely to be left alone. What appear to be hierarchical disputes will sometimes occur and involve charging, flaring of fins, an overall paling of the body colouration, and, in males, extension of the rostral process."],"reproduction":"The results of a study published in 2004 showed that it\u00a0can be induced to spawn via the use of hormones. Eggs hatched in only 15-16 hours at a temperature of 77-84\u00b0F/25-29\u00b0C, the fry were initially fed a diet of rotifers and Moina and over 90% of hatched fry survived the first month. We\u2019re unsure whether the approach has been used in the ornamental trade.","create_time":1426711764.35567}
