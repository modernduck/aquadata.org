It inhabits areas of turbulent water flow, including rapids and highly oxygenated pools below waterfalls."],"maintenance":["","The aquarium should have a fine gravel or sand substrate and a scattering of smooth rocks of varying sizes. Pieces of driftwood can be used to provide areas of shelter. Water flow should be strong and the water well oxygenated. The use of powerheads is recommended. Plants are not essential, although algal growth should not be discouraged. It will not thrive in aquariums with low water movement."],"diet":["","Dried foods may be accepted but the ideal diet for S. brichardi is a varied mix of live and frozen foods supplemented with vegetable matter in the form of blanched spinach, shelled peas, cucumber etc. The fish will rasp at these with the teeth on its lower jaw."],"behaviour":["","A peaceful species but should only be kept with fish that appreciate flowing, oxygenated water. Good tankmates include Steatocranus sp., some Alestiid tetras, Chaetostoma sp., and some of the larger characins and barbs. Should not be kept with territorial species such as other Synodontis."],"reproduction":["","Not reported to have bred in aquaria, although it has been bred for commercial purposes in Eastern Europe with the aid of hormone injections. They are egg scatterers in the wild."],"create_time":1426713934.24739}
