to the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo.\u00a0It\u2019s widely-distributed throughout the south and west of the state and exists in several colour forms depending on locality.","Type locality is \u2018Kuching, Bako National Park, Bukit Gondol, Sarawak, Borneo\u2019,\u00a0and it\u2019s known from other areas ar0und the city of Kuching , plus the districts of Matang, Serian, Gedong, Simunjan and Sri Aman with known range extending eastwards as far as the gold-mining town of Bau."],"habitat":["Sometimes inhabits clear streams with flowing water although most known localities consist of\u00a0blackwater environments in ancient peat swamps, though it\u2019s also been collected from roadside ditches and one population has been discovered living in a small pool at the top of a waterfall.","Both types of habitat are typically shaded from the sun with abundant riparian vegetation.","Blackwaters\u00a0are characteristically stained brown with humic acids and other chemicals released by decaying organic material.","The dissolved mineral content is almost always negligible,\u00a0pH as low as 3.0-4.0 and substrate composed predominantly of fallen leaves, branches and submerged tree roots.","Clearwater streams usually have sandy or rocky substrates covered with a layer of biofilm, and the fish tend to be found in\u00a0marginal zones where the flow is weaker or aquatic plants growing."],"maintenance":["Can be maintained in a fully-decorated aquarium although many breeders prefer not to use a substrate for ease of maintenance.","Driftwood roots and branches can be used and placed such a way that a few shady spots are formed while clay plant pots or lengths of piping can also be included to provide further shelter.","The addition of dried leaf litter further emphasises the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry and the tannins and other chemicals released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial for fishes from blackwater environments.","There is no need to use natural peat, however, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","Like others in the genus this species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting.","You could add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum or Cryptocoryne spp., and a few patches of floating vegetation would be useful as well.","This species requires acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","As it naturally inhabits sluggish waters filtration should not be too strong, with an air-powered sponge filter set to turn over gently adequate.","Keep the tank well-covered and do not fill it to the top as like all Betta spp. it requires occasional access to the layer of humid air that will form above the water surface, and is an excellent jumper."],"diet":["Likely to feed mostly on insects and other small invertebrates\u00a0in nature.","Captive fish\u00a0will normally accept dried products once they\u2019re recognised as edible, but should be offered plenty of small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0or\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0regularly to ensure development of optimal colour and condition.","Take care not to overfeed as\u00a0Betta\u00a0spp. seem particularly prone to obesity."],"behaviour":["Not recommended for the standard\u00a0community\u00a0set-up for reasons already touched upon.","It\u2019s requirements and disposition mean it\u2019s best kept alone or with very peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0since\u00a0much bigger or more vigorous fishes are likely to intimidate and outcompete it.","Some small cyprinids and loaches that inhabit similar environments in nature are compatible, but in most cases it\u2019s best maintained alone.","It can be maintained in a pair or group and will display some interesting behavioural interactions under the latter circumstances."],"reproduction":["Paternal mouthbrooder. Organise a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0for breeding purposes unless the fish are already being maintained alone, setting this up as suggested above.","The\u00a0tank\u00a0should have the tightest-fitting cover you can find (some breeders use clingfilm instead to ensure no gaps) as the\u00a0fry\u00a0need access to a layer of warm, humid air without which development of the\u00a0labyrinth organ\u00a0can be impaired.","A single\u00a0pair\u00a0or group of fish can be used but\u00a0be aware that each male is capable of holding up to 60\u00a0fry\u00a0so considerable space will be needed should you wish to raise them all.","The female plays the more active role in initiating\u00a0courtship\u00a0and defending the area against intruders.","Eggs and milt are released during an \u2018embrace\u2019 typical of osphronemids in which the male wraps his body around that of the female, and several \u2018practice\u2019 embraces may be required before any eggs are released.","Once spawning commences eggs are laid in small batches and picked up in the mouth of the female before being spat out into the water for the male to catch.","Once the male has all the eggs in his mouth the cycle is repeated untill the female is spent of eggs, a\u00a0process\u00a0which can take some time.","The incubation period is 14 \u2013 21 days at which point the male will begin to release fully-formed, free-swimming\u00a0fry.","While some breeders have never had a problem with this\u00a0species\u00a0eating its own young others have lost entire broods\u00a0through predation, but many remove the female (plus any other fishes present) a few days after\u00a0spawning.","This needs to be done as carefully as possible in order to avoid disturbing the male as he may swallow or release the\u00a0brood\u00a0prematurely if stressed.","Once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are swimming and foraging freely the male can also be removed if you wish.","The\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept motile foods such as\u00a0microworm\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0immediately, though it should be noted that there exist reports of young\u00a0Betta\u00a0developing health issues if fed excessive amounts of the latter.","Offer small amounts of different foods 2 -3 times per day for optimal growth rate, and don\u2019t change too much water at once, with regular, small changes preferable to intermittent larger ones."],"create_time":1426710594.7103}
