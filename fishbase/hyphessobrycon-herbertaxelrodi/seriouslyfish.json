The Sepotuba\u00a0empties into the Paraguai main channel around 500 kilometres upstream of\u00a0the Taquiri, thus the species is assumed to occur in other drainages between them.","Many of the fish species inhabiting the upper Paraguai and Panatanal region also occur in the upper rio Guapor\u00e9, known as It\u00e9nez in Bolivia, basin. The latter\u00a0also has its\u00a0headwaters in the\u00a0Pantanal but flows in the opposite direction to the Paraguai and is part of the upper rio Madeira basin, itself a major tributary within the Amazon drainage,\u00a0with\u00a0the two watersheds\u00a0connected due to rising water levels during the annual wet season. Records of a fish identified as H. cf. herbertaxelrodi from Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in the upper Guapor\u00e9, at the border between Bolivia and Brazil, suggest that it might also share this pattern of distribution.","The species has also been introduced into natural waters of Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil via the ornamental trade, with at least one feral population established in the rio Para\u00edba do Sul basin","Type locality is \u2018Coxim on the Rio Taquary [= Taquari], Rio Paraguay [= Paraguai] basin, Mato Grosso, Brazil\u2019."],"habitat":["Appears\u00a0to\u00a0favour minor tributaries, headwater\u00a0rivers, oxbows, and\u00a0seasonally inundated floodplains.","For example, it has been collected from small streams draining to the upper rio Sepotuba in Mato Grosso state, itself a tributary of the upper rio Paraguai. These comprise flowing tributaries measuring a few metres wide with clear, light brown water and thick marginal vegetation. In some places aquatic macrophytes, including members of the genera\u00a0Eleocharis, Echinodorus\u00a0and\u00a0Echinoria, also grow densely.","Sympatric fish species in the Sepotuba watershed include Astyanax assuncionensis,\u00a0Creagrutus meridionalis, Knodus chapadae, Moenkhausia dichroura, Serrapinnus calliurus, Odontostilbe pequira, Pyrrhulina australis, Characidium aff. zebra, Leporinus friderici, Hoplias\u00a0 malabaricus, Farlowella paraguayensis, Rineloricaria cacerensis, Otocinclus sp., Corydoras aff. aeneus,\u00a0Aequidens plagiozonatus, Crenicichla cf. lepidota,\u00a0Gymnotus inaequilabiatus,\u00a0Rivulus aff. picturatus, and Synbranchus marmoratus.","In the Pantanal small characids are often found in extremely clear water where submerged\u00a0vegetation proliferates. The wetland is rich in aquatic macrophytes with at least 280 species recorded, including members of genera popular in the aquarium hobby such as\u00a0Echinodorus, Bacopa,\u00a0Ludwigia, Sagittaria,\u00a0Eleocharis, and\u00a0Salvinia."],"maintenance":["Perhaps looks best\u00a0in an arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches, or heavily-planted planted set-up.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","The latter are useful since they provide an additional food source for both adults and fry while the humic substances released by decaying leaves are also considered beneficial."],"diet":["Likely to be omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It is best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you will be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle."],"reproduction":["An\u00a0egg-scattering free spawner exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition adults will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention, but if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water. This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them. The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles. Alternatively, filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above. An air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container and left in place until eggs are detected (typically the following morning).","Initial food should be\u00a0Paramecium\u00a0or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc.,\u00a0once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426712180.75461}
