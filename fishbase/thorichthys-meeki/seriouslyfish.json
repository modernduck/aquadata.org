It can be kept with similarly-sized Central American cichlids but provide enough space to allow each\u00a0species\u00a0to form an adequate\u00a0territory.","Groups of peaceful upper-water dwelling fishes\u00a0can also be included with the genera\u00a0Poecilia\u00a0and Xiphophorus\u00a0particularly suitable since they have representatives in Mexico.","Unless spawning,\u00a0Thorichthys species are quite gregarious and do best when maintained in groups of 8 or more individuals."],"reproduction":["A biparental, monogamous substrate spawner that is easily-bred when in good condition. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any particular trigger for the spawning process with the main requirements being good diet and stringent maintenance regime, although wild fish may be more seasonally-orientated.","Unless sexed adults are available it\u2019s best to begin with a group of young fish and allow pairs to form naturally, separating them as they do so.","The eggs are normally laid on a solid surface such as a flat rock, piece of driftwood, broad plant leaf, or directly on the aquarium glass. Young or inexperienced pairs may eat the first brood(s), particularly if they feel threatened or are disturbed.","Spawning occurs in typical style with the female laying one or more rows of eggs before the male moves in to fertilise them, the process being repeated numerous times until she is spent.","Several hundred eggs may be deposited and the female stays close to them during the incubation period, tending and defending against intruders, while the male is responsible for defence of the surrounding territory.","If maintaining the adults in a community situation it\u2019s recommended to remove either tankmates or eggs at this point should you wish to raise good numbers of fry.","The latter are easily-fed, accepting good quality powdered dry foods, Artemia nauplii, microworm, etc., as soon as they become free-swimming stage (normally 4-5 days post-spawning). Parental care can continue for several weeks."],"create_time":1426714072.8794}
