This species is imported in mixed batches with the near-identical congener R. candidianus\u00a0which is distributed throughout northern and western Taiwan.","R. nantaiensis\u00a0sensu stricto is not supposed to occur with R. candidianus in nature, and is officially known only from tributaries of the middle and upper\u00a0Tzengwen and Kaoping river\u00a0river basins which drain the southern part of the island."],"habitat":["Presumably inhabits smaller rivers, tributaries and streams with substrates of\u00a0gravel, rocks, boulders, and exposed bedrock which undergo seasonal variations in water flow rate, depth and turbidity.","Southern and western Taiwan has a subtropical monsoon climate characterised by high temperatures and humidity with massive rainfall and tropical cyclones in summer with average annual air temperatutes of 22-24\u00b0C/71.6-75.2\u00b0F, though in winter it typically drops below 20\u00b0C/68\u00b0F.","The balitorid loach\u00a0Sinogastromyzon nantaiensis has an identical natural range and is presumably found in some of the same habitats."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions; we strongly recommend keeping it in a\u00a0tank\u00a0designed to simulate a flowing stream with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel, and some water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc., arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots, thus providing broken lines of sight.","While the majority of aquatic plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as Microsorum, Bolbitis, or Anubias spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive, thus weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should also be considered routine.","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and some water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0meaning power\u00a0filter(s), additional\u00a0powerhead(s), or airstone(s) should be employed as necessary."],"diet":["Rhinogobius\u00a0spp. tend to be opportunistic carnivores feeding on a range of small invertebrates, crustaceans and similar in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they should be offered small live or frozen foods such as\u00a0chironomid\u00a0(bloodworm) or mosquito\u00a0larvae,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Mysis, etc.","Dried foods may be accepted following a period of\u00a0acclimatisation\u00a0but should not be used regularly."],"behaviour":["Can be kept in a\u00a0community\u00a0provided tankmates are chosen with care.","Peaceful,\u00a0pelagic\u00a0species\u00a0which inhabit similar environments in nature such as\u00a0Tanichthys or\u00a0Danio\u00a0species\u00a0are perhaps the best choices for the upper levels, but we\u2019ve also seen\u00a0Rhinogobius\u00a0spp.\u00a0being maintained alongside barbs, small characids, poeciliid livebearers, etc.","It should not mixed with other Rhinogobius spp., especially closely-related ones such as R. candidanus, since it\u2019s not yet clear if they\u2019re capable of hybridisation.","Other bottom-dwellers can include stream-dwelling gobies from genera such as Stiphodon, Sicyopterus, Sicyopus or Schismatogobius spp., diminutive loaches from genera like Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon, or Acanthopsoides, and in high-turnover set-ups obligate torrent-dwellers like Annamia, Homaloptera, etc.","Avoid those that feed aggressively or are excessively territorial, e.g., many Schistura spp.","Larger fishes are best omitted although in very large set-ups it may be possible to add a few non-predatory, surface-dwelling ones, while the majority of cichlids and other\u00a0territorial\u00a0fishes inhabiting the lower reaches should be avoided entirely.","Freshwater\u00a0shrimp from\u00a0genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Caridina\u00a0and\u00a0Neocaridina\u00a0are also unsuitable as they\u2019re likely to be predated upon.","While males are territorial with one another to an extent serious damage is unlikely provided the tank contains sufficient cover, and in fact they appear to actively require the presence of conspecifics.","Aim to purchase at least two males and as many or more females or the fish may become listless and inactive."],"reproduction":["As is typical for the genus eggs are deposited on the ceiling of a cave or crevice and guarded by the male until hatching.","Several potential\u00a0sites should be offered in the form of rocks (flat slate tends to be easiest to handle, see below), terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc.","A nuptial male will select a site and defend it against other males, but if \u00a0one is not available may excavate a cave beneath a rock or other piece of d\u00e9cor.","Spawning occurs secretively within the cave, and is\u00a0usually signified by the pair disappearing from sight for an extended period of time.","The pair may remain inside for 2-3 days with the female ejected once spawning is complete, and they should not be disturbed during this period.","Once the female is seen outside the cave, you can check for eggs by carefully lifting and tilting it without removing from the water.","Inexperienced pairs or males may eat the eggs, attach them poorly, or only partially fertilise them, but after a few attempts normally get things right.","At this point it\u2019s advisable to remove all other fish except the male, or remove male and eggs elsewhere ( a small plastic container can be used to do so without harming either).","Brood size is very large with up to 450 eggs having been observed in a single batch (J. Bauer, pers. comm.), and the eggs themselves are also relatively large as with other\u00a0fluvial\u00a0members of the genus.","Incubation is normally 9-12 days, and fry undergo an initial pelagic stage during which they live and feed up in the water column before dropping to the substrate.","They can be offered\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, microworm, and similarly-sized live foods immediately.","Bear in mind that not only is this species particularly fecund but survival rate also tends to be high, so ensure you possess the facilities to raise 100-200 fry before attempting to breed it."],"create_time":1426713685.34735}
