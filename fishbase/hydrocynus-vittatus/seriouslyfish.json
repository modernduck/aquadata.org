Water should be of the highest quality and well-oxygenated."],"diet":["","It is a piscivore by nature and many sources state that it will only feed on live fish. This is not true and it can be weaned onto whitebait and other dead foods fairly easily."],"behaviour":["","Should really only be kept alone or with other similarly sized members of the same species. There are reports of it being kept with Loricariids, cichlids etc. but these are usually young fish being kept with larger tankmates. Anything smaller than the tiger fish may be ripped to pieces without prior warning."],"reproduction":["","Has been bred in aquaria but little to no information exists. A truly enormous aquarium would be required for any serious breeding attempt."],"create_time":1426712093.2952}
