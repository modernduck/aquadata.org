It\u2019s also found in parts of the Brazilian Rio Negro."],"maintenance":["","Checkerboard Cichlids are very shy fish, often \u201chugging\u201d the bottom of the tank amongst plants and scattered leaves. Provide a well planted aquarium with a great number of hiding places. Floating plants are also an excellent option. Dim lighting is recommended."],"diet":["","Checkerboards will probably accept dry foods, especially sinking cichlid pellets. If that is the case, feed a good quality sinking pellet as staple. Vary their diet with vegetarian or spirulina flakes and plenty of frozen foods. To bring Checkerboards into breeding condition, live foods are highly recommended \u2013 a daphnia culture is great for this purpose."],"behaviour":["","Relatively peaceful cichlids, will struggle against more aggressive tankmates. Fine in a community with other peaceful fish."],"reproduction":["","Dicrossus Filamentosa are relatively easy to breed if you can provide them with premium water conditions. This means very acidic, soft, highly quality water. RO water is nearly mandatory for breeding these fish, unless your tap water is around pH 4.5."],"create_time":1426711593.7441}
