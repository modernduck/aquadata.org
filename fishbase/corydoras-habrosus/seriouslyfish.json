Its distribution in Colombia is less clear but it is known with certainty from\u00a0the R\u00edo Arauca and R\u00edo Casanare, the latter a tributary of the lower R\u00edo Meta, and it makes sense that it should\u00a0also be found in other left bank Orinoco affluents\u00a0between the Meta and Apure, which include the r\u00edos Cinaruco and Capanaparo.","Type locality is \u2018R\u00edo Salinas, tributary of R\u00edo Pao Viejo, El Ba\u00fal, 8\u00b059\u2019N, 68\u00b016\u2019W, Cojedes, Venezuela\u2019."],"habitat":["This species occurs in\u00a0the Llanos Orientales region, a vast tropical grassland plain\u00a0traversed by\u00a0the Orinoco and some of its major left bank tributaries. Large swathes of these plains become flooded during the annual wet season, forming an enormous wetland which is a paradise for wildlife.","C. habrosus apparently displays a preference for lagoons, tributary streams, inundated forest and grassland, and marginal zones, where water flow is not strong. It tends to form aggregations close to submerged vegetation or solid structures such as tree branches or roots.","Other fishes occurring in the region and available in the aquarium trade include Corydoras delphax,\u00a0Platydoras costatus, Baryancistrus beggini, Hypancistrus inspector, Panaqolus maccus, Panaque nigrolineatus, Hemigrammus rhodostomus, H. stictus, Hyphessobrycon sweglesi, Paracheirodon axelrodi, Pristella maxillaris, Copella nattereri, Biotodoma wavrini, Heros severus, Mesonauta insignis, Geophagus abalios,\u00a0Satanoperca daemon and Uaru fernandezyepezi."],"maintenance":["Ideally use a substrate of fine sand, although rounded gravel is an acceptable alternative provided that it is kept scrupulously clean.","Other d\u00e9cor is largely down to personal choice, but some cover should be provided to give the fish security."],"diet":["Corydoras\u00a0spp. are foraging omnivores, and most will accept sinking dried foods as well as small live and frozen varieties such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex, etc.","Feeding a varied diet will ensure\u00a0the fish are in optimum condition.","Under no circumstances should they be expected to survive on \u2018left-overs\u2019 from other inhabitants of the aquarium or relied on to \u2018clean\u2019 the aquarium."],"behaviour":"Peaceful and gregarious. Should be maintained in a \u00a0group of at least 4-6 individuals, ideally 10 or more.","reproduction":["Can be bred in a similar fashion to many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species.","Use a ratio of two or more males per female if possible, and when the females are visibly full of eggs perform a large (50-70%) water change with\u00a0soft, cool\u00a0water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare arrangement."],"create_time":1426711207.52714}
