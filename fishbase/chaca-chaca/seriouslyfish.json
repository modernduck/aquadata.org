The use of a soft, sandy substrate is also recommended as the fish often bury themselves. Most plants will not do well in such conditions, but tolerant species that grow attached to decor, such as java fern and java moss can be used. The addition of some beech twigs and dried oak or beech leaves will help to simulate the natural habitat of the fish."],"diet":["","It is sometimes possible to wean young specimens onto dried or meaty frozen foods. However, many specimens refuse anything but live food. Small fish, river shrimp and earthworms can all be offered."],"behaviour":["","A highly predatory species, C. chaca is best kept alone. It will consume almost any fish that strays close enough to its capacious mouth and is capable of swallowing prey items almost as big as itself. In large, deep aquaria it may be possible to keep it with fast-swimming species that live high in the water column, but even this carries risks. It can however be kept with others of its own kind with no problems."],"reproduction":["","This species has been bred in aquaria. A group of 4 fish spawned in a length of 3\u2033 diameter tubing, with a male fish guarding the eggs over the 3 day incubation period, after which no further parental care was observed. The fry became free swimming after 7 days. Presumably they were raised on small live foods."],"create_time":1426710860.89978}
