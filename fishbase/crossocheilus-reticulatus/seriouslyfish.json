You\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking display plus interesting behaviour from the fish as they interact with one another."],"reproduction":["Not thought to have occurred in the aquarium hobby and as far as we know it\u2019s not being farmed for the trade although related species are induced to spawn artificially via the use of hormones.","Members of this genus are known to undergo seasonal reproductive migrations in nature, moving upstream during the dryer months and in the opposite direction when water levels rise."],"create_time":1426711431.9064}
