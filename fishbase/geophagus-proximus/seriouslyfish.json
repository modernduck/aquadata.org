species is well-dispersed and has been recorded throughout much of the rio Amazonas (Amazon River) system in Peru and Brazil.","It was described from \u2018\u00a0\u2018R\u00edo Ucayali, Mission Saraycu, Peru\u2019\u00a0and has since been recorded along the Solim\u00f5es-Amazon mainstream as far as the rio Trombetas near Santar\u00e9m including the lower reaches of most tributary systems within that range."],"habitat":["Predominantly found in the lower reaches of rivers and has also been collected from floodplain lakes in v\u00e1rzea regions, plus some permanent black water lakes such as Lago Aman\u00e3 near the city of Tef\u00e9, Brazil.","It\u2019s said to show a preference for clear and black water environments as opposed to turbid \u2018white\u2019 waters and tends to inhabit gently sloping marginal zones around shores or islands with substrates of sand, fine gravel and mud.","Depending on locality other habitat features can include scattered rocks, submerged tree roots and branches.","This species occurs alongside many others across its range with some of those from the R\u00edo Ucayali including Anodus elongatus, Hemiodus amazonum, Astyanax villwocki, Creagrutus occidaneus, Hyphessobrycon frankei, Hemigrammus luelingi, Copella nigrofasciata, Apistogramma bitaeniata, A. eunotus, A. nijsseni, A. panduro, Crenicichla proteus, Heros efasciatus, Farlowella platorynchus, Otocinclus cocama, Panaque bathyphilus/L090, Planiloricaria cryptodon, Sturisoma nigrirostrum, Liosomadoras morrowi, Corydoras elegans, C. panda, C. trilineatus and C. virginiae."],"maintenance":["The most essential item of d\u00e9cor is a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0so that the fish can browse naturally (see \u2018Diet\u2019).","Coarser materials such as\u00a0gravel\u00a0or small pebbles can inhibit feeding, damage\u00a0gill\u00a0filaments and even be ingested with the potential of internal damage or blockages.","Additional furnishings are as much a case of personal taste as anything else but the most favoured set-ups tend to feature relatively dim lighting plus some chunks of driftwood and scattered roots or branches.","Leaf litter is a typical feature of the natural environment but not really recommended in aquaria because the feeding behaviour of\u00a0Geophagus\u00a0spp. tends to cause an excess of partially-decomposed material in suspension which not only looks unsightly but can block\u00a0filter\u00a0and\u00a0pump mechanisms.","One or two flattish, water-worn rocks can also be included to provide potential\u00a0spawning\u00a0sites if you wish.","Water quality is of the utmost importance since these cichlids are extremely susceptible to deteriorating water quality and swings in chemical parameters so should never be introduced to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium.","The best way to achieve the desired stability is to over-filter\u00a0the\u00a0tank\u00a0using a combination of external canister filters and/or a\u00a0sump\u00a0system and perform minimum weekly water changes of 50-70%.","If the maintenance regime is insufficient health issues such as\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or\u00a0stunted\u00a0growth can occur.","Mechanical filtration\u00a0should also be tailored to trap small particles stirred up by the fish as\u00a0sand\u00a0can cause blockages and wearing issues with\u00a0filter\u00a0mechanisms if allowed to continually run through the system.","High flow rates should be avoided so position\u00a0filter\u00a0returns accordingly."],"diet":["For this reason they\u2019re commonly termed \u2018eartheaters\u2019 and the provision of a suitable\u00a0substrate\u00a0is essential to their long-term well-being.","Once settled they readily rise into the\u00a0water column\u00a0when food is introduced but continue to browse normally at other times.","The stomach contents of wild specimens mostly comprise small\u00a0aquatic\u00a0and terrestrial invertebrates, plant material in the form of seeds,\u00a0organic\u00a0detritus\u00a0and sediment.","Even as adults these cichlids seem unable to properly ingest larger food items meaning the diet should contain a variety of high quality, fine-grade prepared foods plus small live or frozen bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, mosquito\u00a0larvae, etc.","At least some of the dried products should contain a high proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife.","Rather than a single large meal offer 3-4 smaller portions daily to allow natural browsing behaviour as this seems to result in the best growth rate and condition."],"behaviour":["Unless breeding this\u00a0species\u00a0is surprisingly peaceful and will not predate on fishes larger than a few millimetres in length.","Suitable tankmates are far too numerous to list but include most peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0enjoying similar environmental conditions.","Best avoided are aggressive or\u00a0territorial\u00a0substrate-dwelling\u00a0species, or those requiring harder water.","Some aquarists keep\u00a0Geophagus\u00a0spp. alongside\u00a0freshwater\u00a0stingrays of the\u00a0genus\u00a0Potamotrygon\u00a0which in many cases has proven successful but in some has resulted in them disappearing at night (!).","G. proximus\u00a0is\u00a0gregarious\u00a0and tends to exist in loose aggregations unless\u00a0spawning, with juveniles in particular displaying strong grouping instincts.","A group of 5-8 individuals should be the minimum purchase and these will form a noticeable dominance\u00a0hierarchy.","When maintained in smaller numbers weaker specimens can become the target of excessive antagonism by dominant individuals or the group may fail to settle and behave nervously."],"reproduction":["Substrate-spawning, ovophilous, biparental mouthbrooder that\u00a0has been bred in aquaria.","There doesn\u2019t appear to be any particular trigger for the\u00a0spawning\u00a0process\u00a0with the main requirements being good diet and stringent maintenance regime involving relatively large weekly water changes.","Since accurate\u00a0sexing\u00a0is essentially impossible it\u2019s best to begin with a group of young fish and allow pairs to form naturally.","A degree of patience is also required since it can be at least a year until they become sexually\u00a0mature.","Courtship\u00a0is relatively unobtrusive consisting of\u00a0fin\u00a0flaring, circling, gaping and head jerking displays, and when ready to\u00a0spawn\u00a0a\u00a0pair\u00a0will select a suitable site.","This is normally a piece of d\u00e9cor such as a flat rock or section of driftwood although it\u2019s not unknown for the\u00a0base\u00a0of the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0to be used and once chosen the area is cleaned and defended against intruders.","Spawning\u00a0occurs in typical\u00a0substrate-spawning\u00a0fashion with the female laying one or more rows of eggs before the male moves in to fertilise them, the\u00a0process\u00a0being repeated numerous times over a period of several hours.","Maximum\u00a0brood\u00a0size is around 200 eggs which are normally taken up by the female though on\u00a0rare\u00a0occasions both adults may be involved from the start.","Some males may become aggressive post-spawning\u00a0and drive the female away to care for the eggs alone, but the most common scenario involves her holding the\u00a0fry\u00a0while he defends the surrounding\u00a0territory.","Once the\u00a0fry\u00a0are swimming freely\u00a0brood\u00a0care is shared although this also varies depending on the male with some individuals becoming involved earlier and others not at all.","The parents may participate in mouthbrooding duties simultaneously or by exchanging the entire\u00a0brood\u00a0on a more-or-less daily basis, the transfer normally\u00a0taking place in a sheltered location such as a depression in the\u00a0substrate.","When not brooding the adults will normally feed, and may even take some small morsels while holding\u00a0fry.","At 77 \u2013 82.4\u00b0F/25 \u2013 28\u00b0C the\u00a0fry\u00a0become free swimming at 8-11 days of age and the parents begin to release them to feed, initially with caution but for increasingly longer periods.","If danger is sensed the\u00a0fry\u00a0are shepherded back into the adults\u2019 mouths, with rapid movement of the\u00a0ventral\u00a0fins appearing to act as a signal.","As time elapses and the\u00a0fry\u00a0grow they may only return to their parents\u2019 mouths at night while the size of the territory becomes correspondingly larger.","They\u2019re easily-fed, accepting good quality powdered dry foods,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc. as soon as the free-swimming stage is reached.","If maintaining the adults in a\u00a0community\u00a0situation it\u2019s recommended to remove brooding females as the\u00a0fry\u00a0become easy prey for other fishes, including conspecifics, once released."],"create_time":1426711815.79845}
