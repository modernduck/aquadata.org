It\u2019s situated in a valley, surrounded by hills. It has many large patches of water lilies and other vegetation around its edges The rainbows tend to be found around these, in shallow, clear water."],"maintenance":["","Like most rainbows, this species looks most at home in a planted aquarium. Provide areas of dense vegetation, along with some open areas for swimming. Water movement should be quite gentle. High water quality is essential to the well-being of this species, so weekly partial water changes are recommended."],"diet":["","Unfussy and will accept most dried, frozen and live foods. Regular feedings of the latter will ensure the best colouration."],"behaviour":["","Very peaceful but can disturb smaller or slow-moving fish with its rapid movements and relatively large size. Good tankmates include other similarly-sized rainbowfish, characins, danios, barbs, and catfish such as hard water-tolerant Corydoras.\nIt has quite a skittish nature and does far better when kept in a shoal of at least 6-8 fish, preferably more. The males will also be encouraged to display their best colours in the company of conspecifics. Obviously a suitably-sized aquarium would be required for a very large group."],"reproduction":["","Spawns in a similar egg scattering fashion to other Glossolepis species. ","The breeding tank should be at least 30\u2033 long and contain slightly hard, alkaline water with a pH of around 7.5 and a temperature of 75-80\u00b0F. A small air-powered filter will provide sufficient oxygenation and flow. The tank should be filled with fine-leaved plants such as java moss, or nylon spawning mops. No substrate is necessary.","The adult fish are best conditioned in a group in a separate aquarium with plenty of live and frozen foods. Select the fattest pair for spawning and introduce them to the spawning tank. A small raise in temperature can usually induce courtship. The pair will spawn for a period of several weeks, laying a few eggs each day. These are attached to surfaces by a small thread. Although the adults tend not to eat the spawn, it\u2019s easier to raise the fry in a separate aquarium. We recommend checking the plants or mops daily and removing any eggs you find to a raising tank containing water from the spawning tank.","The eggs hatch in 7-12 days, depending on temperature and the tiny fry initially require infusoria-type food. After a week or so they can be moved onto microworm or brine shrimp nauplii. They\u2019re quite sensitive to unfavourable water conditions and frequent small water changes are a must."],"create_time":1426711843.4876}
