Beamish et al. (2008) recorded it from the Chao Phraya system in central Thailand but this may represent a case of misidentification.","Type locality is \u2018Trang Bom, Vietnam\u2019."],"habitat":["Has been collected from shallow, slow-moving pools of hill streams where leaf litter collects and moderately to fast-flowing habitats with gravel substrate.","Flow, depth and turbidity presumably increase during the annual monsoons but little else is known about its ecology."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions; we strongly recommend keeping it in a\u00a0tank\u00a0designed to resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel, and some water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots, thus providing broken lines of sight.\u00a0While the majority of\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis, or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and some water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0meaning power\u00a0filter(s), additional\u00a0powerhead(s), or airstone(s) should be employed as necessary.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive, meaning weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Nemacheilus\u00a0species\u00a0are\u00a0omnivorous\u00a0although the bulk of their diet consists of small insects, worms, crustaceans and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0with only relatively small amounts of plant matter consumed, mostly via the stomach contents of prey items.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should not be fed these exclusively. Daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, etc., will result in the best colouration and condition.",""],"behaviour":["Fishes which inhabit similar biotopes in nature constitute the best options, especially\u00a0\u00a0peaceful, open water-dwelling cyprinids since the presence of one or two schools can make a visible difference to the confidence of this naturally reclusive loach.","Other possibilities include rheophilic loaches from genera such as Gastromyzon, Pseudogastromyzon, Beaufortia, and Sewellia, plus benthic cyprinids like Crossocheilus and Garra species.","Some similarly-shaped relatives such as other\u00a0Nemacheilus,\u00a0Acanthocobitis,\u00a0and\u00a0Schistura\u00a0spp. are excessively territorial or otherwise aggressive, although a combination may work in larger aquaria.","This\u00a0species\u00a0is peaceful with conspecifics and seems to appreciate being maintained in a group so the purchase of four or more specimens is highly recommended."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded.","create_time":1426712876.47104}
