Since it tends not to dig it can also be maintained in most planted aquaria.","A more natural-looking arrangement might consist of a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with wood roots, branches and leaf litter.\u00a0One or two flattish, water-worn rocks can also be included to provide potential\u00a0spawning\u00a0sites if you wish.","Water quality is of the utmost importance since these cichlids are susceptible to deteriorating water quality and should never be introduced to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium, and high flow rates should be avoided so position\u00a0filter\u00a0returns accordingly.","If the maintenance regime and/or diet is insufficient individuals may develop health problems such as\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or exhibit\u00a0stunted\u00a0growth."],"diet":["Likely to be a foraging omnivore feeding on benthic invertebrates and organic detritus in nature.","In the aquarium it\u2019s unfussy and will accept the majority of prepared foods, though a varied diet containing both quality dried products plus live or frozen bloodworm, Artemia, Daphnia, etc. should be offered for the fish to develop optimal condition.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife."],"behaviour":["Not aggressive unless breeding\u00a0and will not predate on fishes larger than a few mm in length.\u00a0Suitable tankmates are therefore too numerous to list but include most peaceful\u00a0species\u00a0enjoying similar environmental conditions.","Groups of open water-dwelling characids or similar are particularly recommended as C. maronii is naturally shy and the presence of small schooling or shoaling fishes appears to be used as a cue that there are no threats in the vicinity.","When danger is detected the colour pattern darkens considerably and the fish take cover among plants, submerged woody structures, or leaf litter.","For those wishing to attempt a\u00a0biotope-style\u00a0community\u00a0a list of some naturally sympatric\u00a0species\u00a0can be found in the \u2018Habitat\u2019 section of this profile.

Young or inexperienced pairs may eat the first brood(s), particularly if they feel threatened or are disturbed.","Spawning\u00a0occurs in typical style with the female laying one or more rows of eggs before the male moves in to fertilise them, the\u00a0process\u00a0being repeated numerous times until she is spent.","Up to 300 or so eggs may be deposited and the female stays close to them during the\u00a0incubation period, tending and defending against intruders, while the male is responsible for defence of the surrounding\u00a0territory.","If maintaining the adults in a\u00a0community\u00a0situation it\u2019s recommended to remove either tankmates or\u00a0eggs at this point should you wish to raise good numbers of fry.","The\u00a0latter\u00a0are easily-fed, accepting good quality powdered dry foods,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc., as soon as they become free-swimming stage.
