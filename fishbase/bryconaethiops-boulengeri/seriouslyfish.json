The choice of decor isn\u2019t critical, but a substrate of sand with some driftwood branches, and perhaps some smooth rocks can look very effective. Try to leave as much open swimming space as possible."],"diet":["","Omnivorous. Offer a mixture of live, frozen and dried foods. Prawns and live earthworms are particularly relished."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful with anything that isn\u2019t too small as to be considered food. Best kept with other similarly-sized characins, robust cichlids, Loricariids and other bottom dwellers such as Polypterus species. It\u2019s a shoaling species so buy a group if possible."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in the hobby."],"create_time":1426710769.49673}
