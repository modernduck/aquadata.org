It doesn\u2019t appreciate bright conditions and we suggest the use of floating plants to diffuse the light entering the tank. Allow open spaces between areas of planting to allow swimming space."],"diet":["","It prefers live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, earthworms, prawns etc., but most will also take small pellets or flakes. Unlike most Auchenipterids it will usually feed during daylight hours."],"behaviour":["","Safe with all but the smallest of fry and therefore suitable for most community aquaria. Ideally, keep it in a South American biotope aquarium with tetras, dwarf cichlids and other peaceful catfish such as Corydoras sp. and smaller Loricariids. It\u2019 is totally unaggressive towards conspecifics and is happier when kept in a group."],"reproduction":["","Unreported in aquaria."],"create_time":1426714098.33505}
