Total area of occupancy is estimated at less than 10 km\u00b2. <br/> <br/>Standard anthropogenic perturbations to pre\u00f1adilla habitat are the deviation of water currents towards pasture grounds, the periodic vegetation clearing from creeks by communities in order to improve the water supply, the use of pre\u00f1adilla as bait for largemouth bass fishing, the traditional custom of cloth washing in the water in springs, creeks and streams, and the traditional custom also of using aquatic bodies as corridors to move the cattle within the watershed. The use of the local agave called \"cabuya\" (Cactaceae) for the washing of clothes in the creeks and streams is known to have active chemical substances that kill aquatic fauna, including fish (L.
