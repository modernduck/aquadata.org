These subpopulations are distributed in four different drainage basins and their probabilities of escape to other refugia when the environment deteriorates are very limited due to natural and anthropogenic barriers between drainages. Pasture grounds, fields, human settlements, and the presence of the piscivorous largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>) in Imbakucha Lake appear to have resulted in the segregation of those populations within this watershed. Extensive sampling showed that the pre\u00f1adilla is not presently found in Imbakucha Lake and that individuals are concentrated in small lotic-habitat fragments characterized by the presence of springs (V\u00e9lez-Espino, in press). Individuals of <em>Astroblepus ubidiai</em> are concentrated in small areas (range 40\u2013650 m\u00b2) and restricted to island-like habitats, which can be properly defined as refuges.

The use of the local agave called \"cabuya\" (Cactaceae) for the washing of clothes in the creeks and streams is known to have active chemical substances that kill aquatic fauna, including fish (L. V\u00e9lez-Espino, personal observation). <br/><br/>Overfishing may not have been a problem before the population was fragmented by habitat loss. The current fragmentation between subpopulations within the Imbakucha watershed has been enhanced by the introduction of exotics (V\u00e9lez-Espino 2003). Now the concentration of <em>A. ubidiai</em> in a few small localities increases its vulnerability and jeopardizes its persistence. The low probability that dispersers successfully reach other refuges hinders a positive effect of migration on the regional population size (see Fahrig and Paloheimo 1988). During the recovery of the traditional ecological knowledge it was evident that five of former pre\u00f1adilla habitats were converted in reservoirs for human supply and floriculture, four were transformed in community-washing place, two were dried as a consequence of inappropriate agricultural activities, and one was converted into a religious sanctuary (the cave called \"El Socav\u00f3n\" which traditional knowledge recognized as a former source of pre\u00f1adilla). Another former refuge, the Araque spring, was observed in February 2000 to contain pre\u00f1adillas, but by July of the same year it no longer contained pre\u00f1adilla. <br/><br/>In the Imbakucha watershed (Proa\u00f1o, Gallopogyo and Quinde), all six anthropogenic perturbations occur in all of the sites. Approximately 30,000 inhabitants distributed in 38 communities within an area of 150 km\u00b2 have impacted on pre\u00f1adilla habitat and could be a cause of the poor habitat quality.</div>","agents":[{"full_name":"Velez-Espino, L.A.","homepage":"","role":"author"},{"full_name":"Velez-Espino, L.A.","homepage":"","role":"compiler"},{"full_name":"IUCN","homepage":"http://www.iucn.org/","role":"provider"}],"references":[]},{"identifier":"9ff90ff3411cb5c468c02bfea4801ffc","dataObjectVersionID":20928673,"dataType":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","dataSubtype":"","vettedStatus":"Trusted","dataRating":2.5,"subject":"http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/SPMInfoItems#Threats","mimeType":"text/html","language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","rightsHolder":"FishBase","audience":"Everyone","source":"http://www.fishbase.org/summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=49811","description":"Critically Endangered (CR) (B2ab(ii,iii,iv,v))","agents":[{"full_name":"Armi G.
