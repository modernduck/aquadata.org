A sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0with some large chunks of driftwood, or a completely bare arrangement are perhaps the most-favoured options in privately-owned aquaria, but provided water quality is maintained and lighting not too bright this\u00a0species\u00a0is relatively unfussy. An enormous, reliable\u00a0filter\u00a0system and rigorous maintenance regime should be considered mandatory.","diet":"Almost entirely\u00a0piscivorous\u00a0preying on loricariids and other bottom-dwelling fishes in nature but most specimens readily adapt to dead alternatives such as prawn/shrimp, mussel, squid,\u00a0whitebait, strips of larger white fish, etc., in aquaria. Adults require just a single meal per week at most.","behaviour":"Only keep with\u00a0species\u00a0large enough to avoid predation.","reproduction":"Has never been bred in captivity. In nature the congeners\u00a0B. vaillantii\u00a0and\u00a0B. rousseauxii\u00a0are known to undertake extensive, seasonal, upstream migrations which relate directly to the reproductive cycle.","create_time":1426710726.25819}
