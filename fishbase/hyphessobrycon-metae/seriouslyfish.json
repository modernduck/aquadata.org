{"images":[],"distribution":["Endemic to the middle R\u00edo Orinoco watershed in Colombia (departments of Meta, Casanare, Arauca, Vichada, and Guain\u00eda) and Venezuela (states of Amazonas, Apure, Gu\u00e1rico, and Bolivar). It appears to be widespread in\u00a0tributaries between the r\u00edos Ventauri\u00a0and Apure, although the majority of records pertain to\u00a0the R\u00edo Meta\u00a0and its\u00a0affluents, including\u00a0the r\u00edos Humadea, Guatiqu\u00e1, Manacac\u00edas, Cusiana, and Casanare.","Upstream of the Meta\u2019s confluence with the Orinoco it has been collected\u00a0in\u00a0the r\u00edos Ventauri, Guaviare (including the r\u00edos Ariari and In\u00edrida), Tomo, and Cataniapo, while downstream there exist records from the r\u00edos Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Gu\u00e1rico, and Apure. It is also likely to occur\u00a0in other Orinoco tributaries within this region.","Type locality is \u2018Barrigona, R\u00edo Meta, Orinoco system, Colombia\u2019."],"habitat":["It occurs throughout the vast Los Llanos regions of Colombia and Venezuela, and in the latter country is often associated with habitats known as\u00a0morichals\u00a0which tend to contain transparent, clear water and sandy substrates, often with dense growth of aquatic plants or riparian vegetation among which the fish take shelter.","In other parts of its range it has been collected from blackwater streams flowing through tropical rainforest\u00a0and still floodplain lakes, while the majority of rivers and wetlands across its range are subject to extreme flooding\u00a0during the annual rainy season.","One example of a natural habitat is the R\u00edo Cinaruco, a low nutrient, blackwater tributary of the Orinoco in southwestern Venezuela which comprises a meandering river channel with numerous interconnected lagoons and floodplain lakes.","The latter two biotope-types feature reduced water flow, increased turbidity and temperature, a greater accumulation of leaf litter, and higher densities of zooplankton than the main channel.","Other fishes occurring in the R\u00edo Orinoco basin and available in the trade include Corydoras delphax,\u00a0Platydoras costatus, Baryancistrus beggini, Hypancistrus inspector, Panqolus maccus, Panaque nigrolineatus, Hemigrammus rhodostomus, H. stictus, Hyphessobrycon sweglesi,\u00a0Paracheirodon axelrodi, Pristella maxillaris, Copella nattereri, Biotodoma wavrini,\u00a0Heros severus, Mesonauta insignis, Satanoperca daemon and Uaru fernandezyepezi."],"maintenance":["Perhaps looks best\u00a0in an arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches, or heavily-planted planted set-up.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","The latter are useful since they provide an additional food source for both adults and fry while the humic substances released by decaying leaves are also considered beneficial."],"diet":["Likely to be omnivorous\u00a0feeding on small invertebrates, crustacea, filamentous algae, fallen fruit and suchlike in nature.","In aquaria it may survive on a diet of dried foods but like most fishes does best when offered a varied menu which in this case should also contain live and frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm), mosquito larvae,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched community aquarium.","It is perhaps best-maintained alongside similarly-sized characids, gasteropelecids, lebiasinids, smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes and non-predatory, small-to-medium-sized cichlids.","Try to buy a mixed-sex group of at least 8-10 specimens, include other schooling fishes to provide security, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking spectacle."],"reproduction":"Unreported.","create_time":1426712194.43005}
