It generally prefers areas of little or no water movement. Mainly found in freshwater but is also found in brackish environments."],"maintenance":["","The fish like to dig, and sometimes partially bury themselves, so a soft substrate of sand, several inches in depth is recommended. Provide hiding places using large chunks of bogwood, lengths of plastic piping, or clay flowerpots. Dim lighting is also preferable, as this is essentially a nocturnal species."],"diet":["","Although strictly carnivorous in nature, many captive specimens can be trained to take dried pellets. It should definitely be offered a meat-based diet, however. Young fish will accept bloodworm, small earthworms etc., while larger fish will take whole prawns, large earthworms, lancefish and other similar foods. Take care not to overfeed as these fish are very greedy indeed."],"behaviour":["","Territorial with its own kind and will consume any fish it can fit in its capacious mouth. It is therefore best kept alone, although we have seen large specimens coexisting with other similarly-sized fish that inhabitb other parts of the aquarium, such as arowana. Obviously, a very large tank would be required if this is to be attempted."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in captivity. Any attempt would surely prove problematic, due to the adult size of the fish and their territorial, predatory nature."],"create_time":1426713061.90294}
