Reports suggest that the most\u00a0brightly-coloured fish are becoming scarcer and there exists a possibility that selective collection for the aquarium\u00a0trade have altered the structure of wild populations.","That said, very little of the country\u2019s forest cover remains due to\u00a0human activities, with the result that habitat and water quality have been heavily degraded and numerous\u00a0native fish species\u00a0are now considered at risk of\u00a0extinction."],"maintenance":["Choice of d\u00e9cor is not especially critical though it tends to show better colouration in a heavily-planted set-up with a dark\u00a0substrate.","The addition of some floating plants, driftwood roots or branches, and leaf litter\u00a0also seems to be appreciated and adds a more natural feel.","Filtration does not need to be particularly strong though it does seem to appreciate a degree of water movement and will also do well in a hill stream-type set-up."],"diet":["Wild fish are probably foragers feeding on\u00a0diatoms,\u00a0algae,\u00a0organic\u00a0detritus, small insects, worms, crustaceans, and other\u00a0zooplankton.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is easily-fed but the best condition and colours offer regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia, alongside good quality dried flakes and granules, at least some of which should include additional plant or algal content."],"behaviour":["Generally very peaceful making it an ideal resident of the well-researched\u00a0community\u00a0aquarium.","As it places no special demands in terms of water chemistry it can be combined with many of the most popular fish in the hobby including other small cyprinids as well as tetras, livebearers, rainbowfishes, anabantoids, catfishes, and loaches.","It is a\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0by nature, and at least 6-10 specimens should be purchased.","Maintaining it in such numbers will not only make the fish less skittish but result in a more effective, natural looking display, and males will develop better colours in the presence of\u00a0conspecific\u00a0rivals."],"reproduction":["Like most small cyprinids\u00a0Puntius\u00a0spp. are\u00a0egg-scattering free spawners exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it is possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller aquarium\u00a0should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced, and\u00a0spawning\u00a0should take place the following morning.","An alternative is to spawn the fish in a group with half a dozen specimens of each\u00a0sex\u00a0being a good number, although a larger aquarium may be necessary.","In either situation the adults will probably eat the eggs given the chance and should be removed as soon as any are noticed.","These should hatch in 24 \u2013 48 hours with the\u00a0fry\u00a0free swimming around 24 hours later.","They should be fed on an infusoria-grade food for the first few days until large enough to accept microworm, Artemia nauplii, or suchlike."],"create_time":1426713608.37981}
