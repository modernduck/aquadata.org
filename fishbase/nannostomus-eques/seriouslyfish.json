an air-powered sponge-style unit should prove adequate in most cases though a degree of flow is acceptable."],"diet":["A\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and rather timid nature.","In a community it\u2019s best kept with similarly-sized, peaceful characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank, and does not actively predate\u00a0fry.","It\u2019s very much a\u00a0gregarious\u00a0animal so buy as many as possible, ideally 10 or more, as when kept in larger groups any aggression is spread between individuals plus the fish are bolder and exhibit more natural behaviour.","Unlike some relatives rival males rarely spar or do each other harm in any way."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved in aquaria, albeit rarely, and in a densely-planted, mature aquarium it\u2019s possible that small numbers of fry may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to increase the yield of fry a slightly more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but one or more smaller containers should also be set up and filled with aged water.","Unlike the majority of congeners this species deposits its eggs in single batches on the underside of plant leaves, so a clump or two of broad-leaved aquatic plants such as Anubias, Microsorum, or Echinodorus should also be added.","When the adult fish are well-conditioned a single pair or group comprising one or two males and several females can then be introduced to each container, though it\u2019s worth noting that the more individuals involved the greater the risk of egg predation, and this species will eat any eggs it finds.","Once eggs are seen the adults or plant itself should be removed, with a separate hatching tank required using the latter approach.","The first fry should be visible after around 24-36 hours with the majority free-swimming by the 5th or 6th day.","Initial food should be Paramecium or a proprietary dry food of sufficiently small (5-50 micron) grade, introducing Artemia nauplii, microworm, etc., once the fry are large enough to accept them.","In memory of late expert fish-breeder Alan P.
