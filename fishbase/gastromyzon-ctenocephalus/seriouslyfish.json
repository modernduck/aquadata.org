to western Borneo where it\u2019s known only from headwaters of the Sungai (river) Sarawak, Sarawak State, Malaysia and the Sungai Sambas in West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia.","Type locality is \u2018Senah, Sarawak state, Borneo, East Malaysia\u2019 which appears to correspond to\u00a0Kampong Senah Sebuang, near the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan.","All members of the\u00a0genus\u00a0are\u00a0endemic\u00a0to Borneo with over half restricted to just a single\u00a0river basin\u00a0or sub-basin."],"habitat":["Gastromyzon\u00a0spp. are\u00a0obligate\u00a0dwellers of swift, shallow streams containing clear, oxygen-saturated water and have been recorded from sea level to 1350 m amsl throughout hill regions of Borneo.","They typically inhabit riffles and runs and are often found above or below cascades and waterfalls.","Substrates are generally composed of\u00a0gravel, rocks, boulders or bedrock carpeted with a rich\u00a0biofilm\u00a0formed by\u00a0algae\u00a0and other micro-organisms.","Aquatic\u00a0plants are uncommon and while\u00a0riparian\u00a0vegetation may be present these loaches tend to be most abundant in partially or fully-shaded zones.","Field observations have revealed that individuals typically position themselves facing into the flow, either along the sides, behind or under rocks, their specialised\u00a0morphology\u00a0(see \u2018Notes\u2019) allowing them to forage and maintain a particular spot without being swept away.","In nature G. ctenocephalus occus sympatrically with\u00a0Gastromyzon ocellatus, G. stellatus (Sarawak River), G. zebrinus and Homaloptera orthogoniata (Sambas River)."],"maintenance":["Most importantly the water must be clean and well-oxygenated so we suggest the use of an over-sized\u00a0filter\u00a0as a minimum requirement.","Turnover should ideally be 10-15 times per hour so additional powerheads, airstones, etc. should also be employed as\u00a0necessary.","Base\u00a0substrate\u00a0can either be of\u00a0gravel,\u00a0sand\u00a0or a mixture of both to which should be added a layer of water-worn rocks and pebbles of varying sizes.","Aged driftwood can also be used but avoid new pieces since these usually leach tannins that discolour the water and reduce the effectiveness of artificial lighting, an unwanted side-effect since the latter should be strong to promote the growth of\u00a0algae\u00a0and associated microorganisms.","Exposed\u00a0filter\u00a0sponges \u00a0will also be grazed, and some enthusiasts maintain an open\u00a0filter\u00a0in the\u00a0tank\u00a0specifically to provide an additional food source.","Although rarely a feature of the\u00a0natural\u00a0habitat\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants can be used with adaptable genera\u00a0such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Crinum\u00a0and\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. likely to fare best. The latter are particularly useful as their leaves tend to attract algal growth and provide additional cover.","Since it needs stable water conditions and feeds on\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass.","While regular partial water changes are essential\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0can be allowed to grow on all surfaces except perhaps the viewing pane."],"diet":["Much of the natural diet is likely to be composed of\u00a0benthic\u00a0algae\u00a0plus associated micro-organisms which are rasped from solid surfaces.","In captivity it will accept good-quality dried foods and meatier items like live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm\u00a0but may suffer internal problems if the diet contains excessive protein.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients bound with gelatin are very useful since they can be tailored to contain a high proportion of fresh vegetables,\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0and similar ingredients.","For long-term success it\u2019s best to provide a\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0with a plentiful supply of\u00a0algae-covered rocks and other surfaces.","If unable to grow sufficient\u00a0algae\u00a0in the main\u00a0tank\u00a0or you have a\u00a0community\u00a0containing numerous\u00a0herbivorous\u00a0fishes which consume what\u2019s available quickly it may be necessary to maintain a separate\u00a0tank\u00a0in which to grow\u00a0algae\u00a0on rocks and switch them with those in the main\u00a0tank\u00a0on a cyclical basis.","Such a \u2018nursery\u2018 doesn\u2019t have to be very large, requires only strong lighting and in sunny climates can be kept outdoors. Algal\u00a0type\u00a0is also important with\u00a0diatoms\u00a0and softer, green varieties preferred to tougher types such as rhodophytic \u2018black brush\u2019\u00a0algae.","Gastromyzontids are often seen on sale in an emaciated state which can be difficult to correct. A good dealer will have done something about this prior to sale but if you decide to take a chance with severely weakened specimens they\u2019ll initially require a constant source of suitable foods in the absence of competitors if they\u2019re to recover."],"behaviour":["Very peaceful although its environmental requirements limit the selection of suitable tankmates somewhat, plus it should not be housed with any much larger, more aggressive, territorial or otherwise competitive fishes.","Potential options include small, pelagic cyprinids such as\u00a0Tanichthys,\u00a0Danio, and\u00a0Rasbora, stream-dwelling gobies from the genera\u00a0Rhinogobius,\u00a0Sicyopterus, and\u00a0Stiphodon, plus rheophilic catfishes like\u00a0Glyptothorax,\u00a0Akysis\u00a0and\u00a0Hara\u00a0spp.","Some loaches from the families\u00a0Nemacheilidae, Balitoridae and Gastromyzontidae\u00a0are also suitable but others are not so be sure to research your choices thoroughly before purchase.","Gastromyzon\u00a0spp. tend to exist in loose aggregations in nature so buy a group of 4 or more if you want to see their most interesting behaviour.","They\u2019re\u00a0territorial\u00a0to an extent with some individuals appearing more protective of their space than others, often a prime feeding\u00a0spot."],"reproduction":["Has not been bred in aquaria and the only observations we know of for any member of the\u00a0genus\u00a0were made by German\u00a0aquarist\u00a0Philipp Dickmann and published in a hobbyist magazine during 2001.","He collected wild specimens of\u00a0G. scitulus\u00a0(identified as\u00a0G. punctulatus\u00a0at the time) and\u00a0G. monticola, and attempted to\u00a0spawn\u00a0both using different methods.","Initially a\u00a0pair\u00a0of\u00a0G. scitulus\u00a0were placed in a 30\u00a0litre\u00a0tank\u00a0without\u00a0substrate\u00a0or filtration but heavily-aerated and containing some broken flower pots, boulders and floating plants for cover.","These were offered a rich diet with plenty of live and frozen mosquito\u00a0larvae\u00a0to bring them into breeding condition.","The temperature was then raised to 82.4\u00b0F/28\u00b0C over a period of 8 weeks and feeding increased; these conditions were maintained for 3 weeks during which the temperature unintentionally\u00a0rose to 89.6\u00b0F/32\u00b0C.","After\u00a0courtship\u00a0behaviour was observed cool water changes were conducted to bring water temperature down to 77\u00b0F/25\u00b0C and the fish spawned during a period of low air pressure; at the point of climax their bodies are depicted to interlock away from the\u00a0substrate.","At least 100 tiny (diameter <1 mm), sinking, non-adhesive eggs were observed and at this point the adults were removed.","The eggs began to hatch in around 3 days and the\u00a0fry\u00a0were initially photophobic and required an\u00a0infusoria-type\u00a0diet due to their small size (~3 mm SL). Apparently the plants in the\u00a0tank\u00a0began to rot resulting in a loss of water quality and after 3 weeks all the\u00a0fry\u00a0were dead.","More success was had with\u00a0G. monticola, this time using a 160\u00a0litre\u00a0tank\u00a0with a coarse\u00a0gravel\u00a0substrate, some pieces of slate propped up against the\u00a0rear\u00a0pane, a clump of a\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0sp. and a piece of driftwood.","Water temperature was maintained at 75.2\u00b0F/24\u00b0C and\u00a0GH\u00a0was 10-12\u00b0. This was again unfiltered but heavily-aerated with\u00a0Ambastaia sidthimunki,\u00a0Pangio\u00a0sp. and a large\u00a0population\u00a0of the burrowing snail\u00a0Melanoides tuberculata\u00a0also in residence.","On this occasion small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0simply began to appear over time,\u00a0and\u00a0spawning\u00a0was observed continuously over a period of 12 months."],"create_time":1426711788.54115}
