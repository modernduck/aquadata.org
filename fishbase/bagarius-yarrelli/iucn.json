This species is considered to be very widespread by Roberts (1983), but there are indications that only one species is found in the Indian subcontinent (for which <em>B. bagarius</em> is a senior synonym), and that it is not conspecific with species from Southeast Asia. Examination of material reveals that the Indian populations ascribed to this species have thinner pectoral-fin spines that have longer filamentous extensions that may represent an interspecific difference (H.H. Ng <em>pers. comm</em>.). Although it is currently unsure whether the populations in Southeast Asia represent only one or more species, several junior synonyms of <em>B. yarrelli</em> are available (<em>B. lica</em>, <em>B. nieuwenhuisi</em>), should these prove to be distinct from the Indian populations. The only revisionary study by Roberts (1983) is an oversimplification of the taxonomy of the group and the taxonomic status of<em>&#160;Bagarius</em>&#160;from throughout the Indian subcontinent is badly in need of critical study.","rationale":"The taxonomic status of<em>&#160;Bagarius</em>&#160;from throughout the Indian subcontinent is badly in need of critical study. &#160;Irrespective of the confusion surrounding the taxonomy of this species, the currently known populations of&#160;<em>Bagarius yarrelli</em>&#160;are harvested heavily in different parts of its range as food fish and for ornamental trade and as sport fish. &#160; Based on the study in West Bengal the status of the species, as it is currently understood, is assessed as Near Threatened. &#160;It is important that the species should be re-assessed following resolution of its taxonomic uncertainty and the subsequent species identified may all then qualify for a threatened category.","assessor":"Ng, H.H.","evaluator":"Allen, D.J., Vishwanath, W., Molur, S. & Dahanukar, N."}]
