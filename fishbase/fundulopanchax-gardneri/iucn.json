It has also been found along the banks of the lake itself. Currently, the major threat to the subspecies comes from oil plantations and slash and burn agriculture leading to sedimentation and pollution in the lake. There is also a potential threat from the lake 'burping' - CO<sub>2</sub> (as in Lake Nyos and Lake Barombi-Mbo). In addition deforestation of the surroundings of the crater may cause more wind which could lead to the lake 'turning', as the lake is stratified, lower layer being very low in oxygen and high in organic matter. Higher winds may cause currents in the lake which could cause this lower layer to mix with the upper layer where the fish live. This would cause a massive decrease in oxygen in the water and kills the fish.","assessor":"Moelants, T.","evaluator":"Brummett, R., Mbe Tawe, A.N., Dening Touokong, C., Reid, G.M., Snoeks, J.
