It does require well-oxygenated water, however, and live plants tend not to do so well under these conditions. It also prefers a degree of current running through the tank."],"diet":["","Feeds on aufwuchs and small aquatic crustaceans in nature. In the aquarium, it proves omnivorous and will accept both sinking dried foods and live and frozen stuff such as bloodworm or daphnia."],"behaviour":["","A decent choice for the community tank. In a biotope setup, good tankmates include characins such as Anostomus, Hemiodus, Semaprochilodus and Metynnis species, reophilic cichlids such as Retroculus and other Loricariids requiring similar conditions. It can also be kept in a more general community, if you wish. If you\u2019re keeping more than one, ensure each has it\u2019s own refuge to call home, and expect some territorial bickering."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been bred in the hobby. It\u2019s probably a cave spawning species, given its natural habitat."],"create_time":1426711916.8422}
