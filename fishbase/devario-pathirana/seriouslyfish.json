In the aquarium it\u2019s a largely unfussy feeder and will accept most foods.","A good quality dried product can be used as the staple diet but this should be supplemented with regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as bloodworm, Daphnia, Artemia, etc., for the best colouration and conditioning."],"behaviour":["Not especially belligerent but can upset very slow-moving or shyer tankmates with its constant activity and vigorous feeding behaviour, and may nip trailing fins.","It\u2019s therefore only appropriate for larger tanks containing robust, similarly-sized tankmates.","There are plenty of suitable choices including many cyprinids, loaches, cichlids, catfishes and characids although as always when selecting a compatible community of fish proper research is essential.","It occurs in schools by nature so the purchase of a minimum 6-10 specimens is recommended since this will result in a more effective, natural looking display as well as help reduce any nervous behaviour and encouraging males to display their best colours.","Further, this species is more combative than most members of the genus so maintaining it in decent numbers is useful because any aggressive interactions will normally be restricted to conspecifics, and the provision of multiple rivals should mean no single, weaker individual is harassed excessively."],"reproduction":["Like most small cyprinids\u00a0Devario\u00a0spp. are\u00a0egg-scattering free spawners exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a well-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller\u00a0tank\u00a0with a\u00a0base\u00a0measuring around 45 cm x 30 cm should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or wool mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced.","If ready\u00a0spawning\u00a0usually taking place within 24 hours,\u00a0with the female tending to appear noticeably slimmer after the event, and after 48 hours the adults should be removed whether this is observed or not.","Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but typically lasts 24-36 hours with the young free-swimming a few days later.","Initial food should be Paramecium or similar, introducing Artemia nauplii, microworm, powdered dry foods, etc., once the fry are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426711578.51253}
