It is seldom taken for food but juveniles enter the ornamental fish trade due to the attractive colour pattern and the species faces persecution in some areas due to fear of sting injuries. Its relatively limited distribution renders it vulnerable to habitat degradation. The lack of life history and population data for this species preclude an accurate assessment of its conservation status, although studies are currently underway and a revised assessment is recommended in the near future.","assessor":"Charvet-Almeida, P., Rosa, R.S. & Pinto de Almeida, M.","evaluator":"Kyne, P.M., Cavanagh, R.D. & Fowler, S.L.
