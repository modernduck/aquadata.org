These are often shaded by surrounding forest cover with the\u00a0substrate\u00a0normally composed of coarse\u00a0sand,\u00a0gravel, rocks and boulders covered with an epilithic layer of\u00a0algae,\u00a0diatoms\u00a0plus other microorganisms and\u00a0detritus.","Aquatic plants usually absent, though\u00a0Lagenandra\u00a0and\u00a0Blyxa\u00a0spp. have been observed at some lower-gradient habitats.","Flow rate and\u00a0turbidity\u00a0vary somewhat depending on the time of year with both increasing dramatically during the annual monsoon season which occurs between June and September.","In the Panniyar river basin, Kerala it was collected alongside Haludaria fasciata, Tor khudree, Barilius bakeri, Devario aequipinnatus, Rasbora daniconius, Garra mcclellandi, Homaloptera santhamparaiensis, the congener Mesonoemacheilus guentheri and a Glyptothorax sp. during one study."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions; we strongly recommend keeping it in a\u00a0tank\u00a0designed to resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel, and some water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots, thus providing broken lines of sight.","While the majority of aquatic plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as Microsorum, Bolbitis, or Anubias spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and some water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0meaning power\u00a0filter(s), additional\u00a0powerhead(s), or airstone(s) should be employed as necessary.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive, meaning weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["Mesonoemacheilus\u00a0species\u00a0are\u00a0omnivorous\u00a0although the bulk of their diet consists of small insects, worms, crustaceans and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0with only relatively small amounts of plant matter consumed.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should not be fed these exclusively.","Daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, etc. will result in the best colouration and condition."],"behaviour":["This\u00a0species\u00a0can apparently exhibit contrasting behaviour in captivity with some aquarists reporting it to be peaceful while others claim it to be\u00a0territorial\u00a0and aggressive.","It\u2019s unknown if such differences relate to different wild populations,\u00a0gender\u00a0or some environmental variable but caution is recommended if introducing it to an established\u00a0community.","UK aquarist Andy Rushworth found that transferring his previously combative\u00a0M. triangularis\u00a0to an entirely bare set-up resulted in a total loss of aggression though this option may of course not always be feasible or preferable.","At any rate, robust fishes which inhabit similar biotopes in nature, especially small, open water-dwelling cyprinids constitute the best options in terms of tankmates, with smaller species best omitted in shallower (<45 cm deep) tanks as they may prove unable to cope with persistent attacks.","Other possibilities include rheophilic loaches from genera such as Pseudogastromyzon, Beaufortia and Sewellia (avoid the more delicate genera, e.g., Gastromyzon) plus benthic cyprinds like Crossocheilus and Garra species.","Similarly-shaped relatives such as other\u00a0Nemacheilus,\u00a0Acanthocobitis\u00a0and\u00a0Schistura\u00a0spp. are not really recommended although a combination may work in larger aquaria, while sedate bottom-dwellers such as\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0spp. catfishes are best omitted entirely.","This\u00a0species\u00a0is normally tolerant of conspecifics and seems to appreciate being maintained in a group, though as mentioned it can exhibit extreme\u00a0territorial\u00a0behaviour in some cases.","The purchase of four or more specimens is nonetheless recommended since observations of its\u00a0native\u00a0habitats suggest it occurs in quite large aggregations."],"reproduction":["A single success\u00a0was reported by an American\u00a0aquarist\u00a0in 2004.","An adult\u00a0pair\u00a0was removed from a\u00a0community\u00a0set-up containing several loach\u00a0species\u00a0and introduced to a 38\u00a0litre\u00a0tank\u00a0fitted with a small hang-on\u00a0filter, the outflow of which was directed towards a plastic box filled with\u00a0aquarium\u00a0gravel.","Two large\u00a0spawning\u00a0mops were also added and weighed down using a piece of tile, and the author noted that the male was exhibiting reflective reddish-bronze colouration in the lower body and belly.","The male was however found dead the morning so a second individual was introduced since the female still appeared to be\u00a0gravid.","The following day the fish were observed swimming up and down one side of the\u00a0tank\u00a0together, then entering one of the mops.","Close examination using a magnifying glass revealed \u2018hundreds\u2019 of clear, non-adhesive eggs on the\u00a0base\u00a0of the\u00a0tank, and the adults were then removed after the male was seen eating them. Water temperature was 76\u00b0F/24.4\u00b0C.","The eggs were examined under a microscope at various stages of development and recorded to swell to a size of approximately 0.7 mm with a cellular cap apparent at just 3 hours of age.","Hatching seemingly began around 24 hours post-fertilisation, and once complete the mops, tub of\u00a0gravel\u00a0and hang-on\u00a0filter\u00a0were removed with the latter replaced by an air-driven\u00a0sponge filter.","Once the first few\u00a0fry\u00a0showed signs of eye and intestinal development and had apparently consumed the\u00a0yolk sac\u00a0they were fed small amounts of \u2018fry\u00a0starter\u2019, presumably a proprietary product, and by squeezing the sponge from a\u00a0mature\u00a0filter\u00a0into the\u00a0tank.","Artemia\u00a0nauplii\u00a0were introduced to the diet 24 hours later and progressively larger foods as the young fish grew. 500 individuals were eventually raised to saleable size."],"create_time":1426712675.97456}
