Previously it was thought to be Extinct in the Wild and it is believed to be extirpated across its range apart from one location (C. Vidthayanon pers. comm.) in the Chao Phraya (extent of occurrence and area of occupancy both less than 10 km\u00b2). Historically it has been threatened by high levels of harvesting for the aquarium trade, but now this is supplied entirely by captive bred individuals. Currently the major threat to the wild population is pollution from agricultural and domestic sources. More research is needed on this species' presence across its range and a reintroduction programme is recommended.","assessor":"Vidthayanon, C.","evaluator":"Parenti, L., Kottelat, M. & Smith, K."}]
