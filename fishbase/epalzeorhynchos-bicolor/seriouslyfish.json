Its current status is thus unclear and it is considered critically endangered pending further occurrence records.","All fish traded for ornamental purposes are produced on a commercial basis, probably via the use of hormones."],"habitat":["The specimen recently collected from the Mae Klong was obtained from a flowing stretch of clear water of over a metre in depth, with a substrate of sand and large rocks. Sympatric fish species included\u00a0Clupeichthys goniognathus,\u00a0Notopterus notopterus,\u00a0Rasbora aurotaenia,\u00a0Barbonymus schwanefeldii,\u00a0Cirrhinus molitorella,\u00a0Opsarius koratensis,\u00a0Mystacoleucus obtusirostris,\u00a0Osteochilus vittatus,\u00a0O. microcephalus,\u00a0Nemacheilus masyae,\u00a0Homalopteroides smithi,\u00a0Acanthopsoides gracilentus, Pangio oblonga,\u00a0Pseudomystus siamensis,\u00a0Dermogenys siamensis,\u00a0Mastacembelus favus,\u00a0Pristolepis fasciata, and\u00a0Parambassis siamensis.","Other members of the genus tend to be found in flowing rivers and streams and are known to move into temporally-inundated floodplains or forested areas during the wet season. It is these migratory patterns that are thought to have been disrupted by human development."],"maintenance":["Provided sufficient cover is available this species is relatively unfussy in terms of d\u00e9cor, and should not harm softer-leaved plants. However it will thrive in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing river with a substrate of variably-sized rocks, gravel and some larger, water-worn boulders.","This\u00a0can be further furnished with driftwood roots and branches plus aquatic plants\u00a0from genera such as Microsorum, Bolbitis or Anubias\u00a0which can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor. Bright lighting will promote the growth of algae and associated microorganisms,\u00a0upon which the fish will graze.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s quite intolerant to the accumulation of organic wastes and does best\u00a0if there is a high level of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and moderate water movement."],"diet":["Primarily an aufwuchs grazer feeding on algae, small crustaceans, insect larvae, etc., and for it to develop its best colours and condition it should be offered regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm), Daphnia and Artemia along with good quality dried flakes, granules and fresh plant material.","Shelled peas, cucumber, blanched courgette, spinach and chopped fruit all make good additions to the menu. Once settled\u00a0it will often ascend into midwater to feed and browse\u00a0the biofilm that tends to form on rockwork and other solid surfaces."],"behaviour":["Though normally sold as such this species is largely unsuitable for the general community aquarium. This does not mean to say it must be kept alone, rather that tankmates must be chosen with care. While small specimens tend to hide away much of the time they become increasingly\u00a0territorial\u00a0as they grow and can display particularly high levels of aggression towards similar-looking\u00a0species.","Some individuals are more belligerent than others and there exist reports of apparent alliances with other species such as Chromobotia macracanthus. We\u2019re unsure if these behavioural differences are indicative of gender but at any rate loaches from the genera Chromobotia, Botia, Syncrossus and Yasuhikotakia do seem to be left in peace by Epalzeorhynchos species whereas congenerics and members of Crossocheilus, Garra and Gyrinocheilus, for example, tend to be attacked constantly. Please note that in terms of the loaches not all may be housed together and proper research is essential.","Other bottom-dwelling fishes including cichlids and most catfish are best avoided as they may too be picked on. For the upper levels choose\u00a0robust, active, schooling cyprinids. Ideally the\u00a0Epalzeorhynchos\u00a0should be the final addition to the\u00a0tank\u00a0in order to avoid it claiming ownership of the entire space.","This species probably lives a solitary lifestyle and in nature would probably have only come into contact with others of its own kind infrequently and during the\u00a0spawning\u00a0season.\u00a0These instincts heighten as the fish get older and we therefore recommend it be kept singly in the majority of cases. In a very large\u00a0tank\u00a0with lots of cover a cohabitation attempt might be possible but each individual is likely to require a\u00a0territory\u00a0with a diameter of at least a metre."],"reproduction":"As far as we know it has not been bred in private aquaria. Large numbers are produced on commercial farms via the artificial use of hormones.","create_time":1426711652.21711}
