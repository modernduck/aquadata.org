Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting. You can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, especially\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also useful.","For breeding purposes acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness are required so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","There is no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","It goes without saying that this species is sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria."],"diet":["Probably a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species but does not make an ideal community fish due to its small size and somewhat specialised requirements.","Other small tetras such as Lepidarchus adonis or Neolebias ansorgii make good tankmates as in fact do most similarly-sized, quiet species that enjoy comparable conditions such as many smaller cyprinids, anabantoids, callicthyids and loricariids.","It\u2019s also a suitable companion for many smaller cichlid species, but in all cases thorough research should be conducted prior to purchase.","Try to buy at least 8-10 specimens since this species is gregarious and the fish will not only be less shy but display more interesting behaviour when maintained in larger groups."],"reproduction":["Not often bred in aquaria although it is apparently possible with soft, acidic water a prerequisite.","In a\u00a0mature\u00a0set-up\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention but should you wish\u00a0to maximise yield a more controlled approach using a separate aquarium is preferable.","Good results can apparently be had using a layer of peat topped with a mesh or grille to prevent the adults eating the eggs, and plenty of vegetation with Taxiphylum spp. ideal.","The adults are conditioned with plenty of live foods before being introduced to the spawning tank in the evening, and should be removed as soon as possible post-spawning, this normally denoted by the female appearing noticeably slimmer.","Incubation is 24-36 hours with the fry free-swimming within a week, and when they can be seen actively looking for food should be offered microscopic food for the initial period.","It can be up to a fortnight before they\u2019re large enough to accept Artemia nauplii and similar.","The fry are supposedly very sensitive to fluctuating chemistry and may do best if no water at all is changed during their first few weeks of life."],"create_time":1426712359.42301}
