Some of these habitats contain brackish water."],"maintenance":["","Best kept in a heavily-planted setup with twisted roots and branches to provide additional cover. The use of floating plants to diffuse the light is also recommended. This species is very sensitive to deteriorating water conditions, so regular partial water changes are a must."],"diet":["","Relishes all kinds of shellfish, as well as worms and other meaty live and frozen foods. It should be fed snails and unshelled shellfish (such as crab legs, mussels etc.) regularly, in order to maintain its sharp teeth. As with other puffers, these grow continuously and become a problem for the fish if they are not kept ground down."],"behaviour":["","A generally aggressive and intolerant species that really should be kept alone. Its beak-like mouth can easily bite chunks from other fish, or in extreme cases rip them to pieces. It\u2019s also very aggressive towards conspecifics and should never be kept in groups."],"reproduction":["","Has been achieved in aquaria, but little data is available. Apparently the male exhibits some degree of brood care."],"create_time":1426714022.42988}
