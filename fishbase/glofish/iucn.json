The latest fisheries stock assessment estimates that the SSB in 2012 was approximately 4% of the stock\u2019s estimated unfished SSB levels. Moreover, the average recruitment in the last five years may also be below the historical average level of recruitment, with the recruitment level in 2012 being the 8th lowest in 61 years. Additionally, there is concern that optimistically high levels of adult natural mortality and assumptions of no relationship between recruitment and biomass used in the most recent stock assessment may have contributed to an overly optimistic stock outlook. Furthermore, the current fishery may be dependent on one strong cohort, which will likely disappear given the targeting of juveniles in the Western Pacific (Maunder<em> et al.</em> 2014). For these reasons, this species is listed as Vulnerable under Criterion A2bd. Based on the current WCPFC and IATTC management and conservation measures, it is unlikely that the status of the stock will improve if low recruitment continues, therefore, more effective management measures to reduce fishing mortality and increase SSB are needed.&#160;</p>","assessor":"Collette, B., Fox, W., Juan Jorda, M., Nelson, R., Pollard, D., Suzuki, N. & Teo, S.","evaluator":"Polidoro, B. & Carpenter, K.E."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"ANIMALIA","phylum":"CHORDATA","class":"REPTILIA","order":"SQUAMATA","family":"AGAMIDAE","genus":"Agama","species":"lionotus","authority":"Loveridge, 1923","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":170371,"main_common_name":"Mwanza Flat-headed Rock Agama","modified_year":2014,"category":"LC","criteria":null,"assessmentid":"44810595","trend_id":3,"biome_marine":false,"biome_freshwater":false,"biome_terrestrial":true,"taxonomicnotes":"<i>A. mwanzae</i> was previously regarded as a subspecies of <i>A. planiceps</i> Peters, 1862 (Spawls <i>et al.</i> 2002).","rationale":"<em>Agama mwanzae</em> has been assessed as Least Concern due to its large distribution and tolerance of anthropogenic environments.

Elsewhere, declines in wild populations in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea have been noted, but remain to be quantified. <em>Takifugu chinensis</em> is threatened by overfishing resulting from fisheries mismanagement, as well as pollution, urban development and possibly the effects of wide-spread aquaculture of the closely-related congener<em> T. rubripes. </em>The escape or intentional release of aquacultured<em> T. rubripes&#160;</em>threatens the genetic integrity of this species through possible introgression and hybridization, and large-scale aquaculture operations with high mortality rates may introduce pathogens to wild populations. This species is harvested by bottom long-line fishing, which is very efficient in the capture of this and other <em>Takifugu</em> species.

Therefore, we list this species as Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd. We accept current taxonomy that this species is valid (Eschmeyer 2011) and although taxonomic problems persist for this putative species, it is clear that even at the population level there have been severe population declines. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu </em>genus, and the  prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend  further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological  methods. <em>Takifugu chinensis</em> also occurs in several marine protected areas throughout its distribution.

It is found in the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas. It is a coastal species which is found at depths ranging from 10 to 135 m. This species is dependent on estuaries for spawning. Juveniles mature in estuaries and migrate offshore to spawn.<em> Takifugu rubripes</em> is a highly prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Population declines which have been attributed to the use of highly-effective fishing gear have been recorded in parts of its range, however range-wide information is currently not available. Available landing information from Japan indicates landings have declined to about 5% of their historical peak from 1987 to 2004. Stocks in the Seto Inland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and a decline in anchovy stocks. Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is aquacultured in large quantities in order to meet consumer demand, however wild-caught <em>T. rubripes</em> remain highly valued. Stock enhancement programs using aquacultured<em> T. rubripes</em> are in place, however the efficacy of these programs is unknown and mortality in aquaculture is high due to parasitic diseases, which may become introduced into wild populations. Genetic diversity is maintained in both wild populations but is decreased in cultured populations, which may reduce the overall fitness of this species. Available information suggests that <em>T. rubripes</em> has undergone significant population declines in parts of its range. As a highly-valued foodfish the persistence of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em> is highly dependent on species-specific regulatory measures including an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, mandated release of small fishes, and aquacultured fish to meet increasing consumer demand.

Recent landings from Japan indicate a 60% decline from 2003 to 2007, however this is a short time period and this species appears to be common and abundant in other parts of its range. Several recommendations for the management of Fugu stocks were made using <em>T. rubripes</em> as an example, including setting gear restrictions and mandating that fishers  catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing  season. Additionally, <em>T. porphyreus</em> is found in marine protected areas in parts of its range. Landing statistics are only available over a short time period of about four years, however sharp declines have been noted, and this species commands a high price. Pending additional information, <em>T. porphyreus</em> is assessed as Least Concern.<span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><span class=\"sheader5\"><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","assessor":"Shao, K., Liu, M., Jing, L., Hardy, G., Leis, J.L. & Matsuura, K.","evaluator":"Zapfe, G. & Lyczkowski-Shultz, J."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"ANIMALIA","phylum":"CHORDATA","class":"ACTINOPTERYGII","order":"TETRAODONTIFORMES","family":"TETRAODONTIDAE","genus":"Tetrodon","species":"amboinensis","authority":"(G\u00fcnther, 1870)","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":193695,"main_common_name":"Natal Toby","modified_year":2014,"category":"LC","criteria":null,"assessmentid":"2261759","trend_id":4,"biome_marine":true,"biome_freshwater":false,"biome_terrestrial":false,"taxonomicnotes":"The genus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Canthigaster</span> is  hypothesized to undergo fast morphological/colour differentiation and  slow mtDNA evolution (Randall <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">et al</span>. 2008).","rationale":"<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Canthigaster natalensis</span> is known in the western Indian Ocean from Mozambique to South Africa and La R\u00e9union, east to the Changos archipelago.

However, the EOO is still inferred to exceed the threshold for a threatened category. It is often found in riparian forest and more open areas along watercourses and forest clearance, damming, pollution and conversion to rice and fish farming are all threats that are likely to directly affect this species. Its preference for riparian habitats may mean that the area of occupancy (AOO) is in decline due to the habitat changes currently occurring along many of the rivers in the region (although it was not possible to estimate actual values for present and future AOO). The species is considered threatened in Japan, where the majority of rivers have been stripped of their forest habitat (Oshima <em>et al.</em> 1997), and only a few patches remain. However, it is inferred that the area of occupancy (AOO) and population at present exceed the thresholds for a threatened category. In the Rare Plants Data Book of Korea it is listed as nationally Least Concern (Korea national Arboretum 2009). It is found within several protected areas and it is conserved <em>ex situ</em> in several botanical institutions around the world. It is assessed as Least Concern.

The notion that these two forms are \"bridged\" by<em>maculatus</em>, with a throw-away description of&#160;<em>ramsayi</em>&#160;as \"aberrant\" (Salomonsen 1953), not only fails to deal with the suggestion of Voous (1947) that&#160;<em>ramsayi</em>&#160;represents an early invasion of the Philippines, but also misses the point that&#160;<em>maculatus</em>&#160;is not geographically interposed between the two forms it is supposed to bridge. It is worth noting that in the paper in which both&#160;<em>ramsayi&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>fulvifasciatus</em>&#160;were first established, the formal description of&#160;<em>ramsayi</em>&#160;compared it to&#160;<em>temminckii&#160;</em>rather than to&#160;<em>maculatus</em>&#160;(Hargitt 1881).<em><p></p></em>","rationale":"This woodpecker qualifies as Vulnerable because its range and population are both regarded as very small and undergoing rapid declines as a result of habitat loss. <p></p>","assessor":"BirdLife International","evaluator":"Butchart, S. & Symes, A."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"ANIMALIA","phylum":"CHORDATA","class":"AVES","order":"PICIFORMES","family":"PICIDAE","genus":"Picoides","species":"dorae","authority":"(Bates & Kinnear, 1935)","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":22681095,"main_common_name":"Arabian Woodpecker","modified_year":2012,"category":"VU","criteria":"C2a(ii)","assessmentid":"40633020","trend_id":2,"biome_marine":false,"biome_freshwater":false,"biome_terrestrial":true,"taxonomicnotes":"<em>Dendropicos dorae</em>&#160;(del Hoyo and Collar 2014) was previously placed in the genus&#160;<em>Dendrocopos</em>.","rationale":"This species is listed as Vulnerable because it has a small population, which is likely to be declining as a result of excessive cutting and lopping of trees for charcoal, firewood and fodder, in parts of its range. <p></p>","assessor":"BirdLife International","evaluator":"Butchart, S. & Symes, A."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"ANIMALIA","phylum":"CHORDATA","class":"AVES","order":"PICIFORMES","family":"PICIDAE","genus":"Picoides","species":"dorae","authority":"(Bates & Kinnear, 1935)","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":22681095,"main_common_name":"Arabian Woodpecker","modified_year":2012,"category":"VU","criteria":"C2a(ii)","assessmentid":"40633020","trend_id":2,"biome_marine":false,"biome_freshwater":false,"biome_terrestrial":true,"taxonomicnotes":"<em>Dendropicos dorae</em>&#160;(del Hoyo and Collar 2014) was previously placed in the genus&#160;<em>Dendrocopos</em>.","rationale":"This species is listed as Vulnerable because it has a small population, which is likely to be declining as a result of excessive cutting and lopping of trees for charcoal, firewood and fodder, in parts of its range. <p></p>","assessor":"BirdLife International","evaluator":"Butchart, S. & Symes, A."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"ANIMALIA","phylum":"CHORDATA","class":"AVES","order":"GRUIFORMES","family":"RALLIDAE","genus":"Tribonyx","species":"ventralis","authority":"(Gould, 1837)","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":22692893,"main_common_name":"Black-tailed Native-hen","modified_year":2013,"category":"LC","criteria":null,"assessmentid":"49895714","trend_id":3,"biome_marine":false,"biome_freshwater":true,"biome_terrestrial":true,"taxonomicnotes":"<em>Tribonyx ventralis</em>&#160;(del Hoyo and Collar 2014) was previously placed in the genus&#160;<em>Gallinula</em>.","rationale":"This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2 </sup>combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation).

Encounter rates from these surveys were used as a measure of relative porpoise abundance in a generalized linear model (GLM) that accounts for differences in survey method and relative porpoise abundance in different sections of the Yangtze River. Factors included in the GLM analysis were: river section (i.e., Yichang-Ezhou, Ezhou-Huayang, and Huayang-Shanghai), boat size (large/small), boat number (multiple/single), water season (high/low), and observer number (multiple/single). Our analyses indicate that the population in the upper survey section (Yichang-Ezhou) showed the greatest rate of decrease (r = -7.7% yr<sup>-1</sup>, 1990-2007), while populations in the middle and lower sections (Ezhou-Huayang and Huayang-Shanghai) showed lower rates of decrease (r = -6.2% yr<sup>-1</sup>, 1990-2007). The average rate of decline across the whole river was 6.4% yr<sup>-1</sup>(1990-2007). We therefore predict that porpoise population change in the main Yangtze channel over three generations from 1990-2040 (T=16.5 yrs, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007) would be 92.4%.<br/><br/>According to the criteria of CR(A4b): \u201c<em>An observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of \u226580% over any 10 year or three generation period, whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years in the future), where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible, based on:</em><em>(b) an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon</em>\u201d<br/><br/>The Yangtze Finless Porpoise population should therefore be classified as CR (A4b).<br/><br/><strong>Justification 2 from life table analysis (data for criterion A: rate of population reduction; and criterion E: quantitative analysis):</strong><br/><br/>We used data from 279 incidentally-killed Yangtze Finless Porpoises that were collected along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River from 1978 onwards to construct population life tables for two time intervals, before 1993 and after 1993. Demographic rate estimates revealed an accelerating porpoise decline according to the instantaneous rate of increase (r), from r= -1.59% in the pre-1993 population to r= -6.25% in the post-1993 population. We then predicted a three-generation reduction from 2008-2058 (T = 16.5 yrs, Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) in the post-1993 scenario. We predict that over 93.95% (SD = 4.63%) of the current population will be lost in the next three generations based on an individual-based Leslie matrix model (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>According to the criteria of CR A3b: \u201c<em>A population size reduction of \u226580%, projected or suspected to be met within the next 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years)</em>\u201d<br/><br/>The Yangtze Finless Porpoise population should therefore be classified as CR (A3b).<br/><br/>Calculation based on the same model (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012) revealed the probability of extinction of Yangtze Finless Porpoise within the next three generations is extremely high (58.55%, SD = 1.03%).<br/><br/>According to the criteria of CR (E): \"<em>Quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 50% within 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer (up to a maximum of 100 years)</em>.\"<br/><br/><strong>The quantitative analysis referred to above is currently under review by IUCN to confirm whether its use for criterion E is appropriate. Criterion E is therefore not used in this current assessment pending the outcome of that review.

It has also been argued that given conservation objectives the issue of whether or not Northern White Rhino should be treated as a species or subspecies is for practical purposes somewhat academic given: 1) the high degree of relatedness of the four remaining Northern White Rhinos at Ol Pejeta (calculated Founder Genome Equivalent of only 1.71);&#160; 2) the fact that any pure-bred offspring from remaining animals would&#160; be inbred; 3) the need to maximise reproductive output from all these NWR animals (only one of which is young) to try to retain as many adaptive NWR genes as possible (by minimising loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift); and 4) constraints to reproductive output given that the two NWR males are old and there are only two NWR females and only one of these is a young animal. Conservation biologists Bob Lacy and Kathy Traylor-Holzer have advised that given the above situation and overall conservation objective, a stage has been reached where one doesn\u2019t really have any choice of achieving medium to longer term conservation goals without trying inter-crossing NWR with Southern White Rhino so as to preserve some NWR genes within breeding populations that can hopefully later resume evolutionary adaptation to wild habitats. They have advised that even in the total absence of human-caused losses (e.g., to poaching), genetic and demographic modelling of such a small population of inter-related animals shows that the remaining four NWR are unlikely on their own to form a viable population in the longer term because of the negative effects of the severe inbreeding that would most likely occur, and the high probability of chance demographic events significantly reducing or eliminating the remnant population at some time before it has a chance to grow to safer numbers. Thus attempts at only pure breeding of NWR alone under these circumstances seem very likely to fail in the medium to longer term, and are at best might only be able to preserve inbred \u201cmuseum specimens\u201d that would not appropriately represent the original NWR. There can be no guarantee that this last-ditch attempt to conserve adaptive Northern White Rhino genes will succeed and inter-crossing may end up not being successful and in due course this would provide some support to Groves\u2019 proposal that the NWR should be classed as a separate species.","rationale":"<p>The previous only confirmed wild population of the subspecies in the Garamba National Park and surrounding hunting areas in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo is now considered to have probably gone extinct. There have been no reported live sightings of any of the last four rhinos since 2006 or their signs since 2007 despite an intensive systematic ground search looking for rhinos and their signs in 2008. Additional aerial searches and field range patrols have also not found any remaining rhino although one carcass has been found. While there are reports of a small number possibly surviving in a remote area of Southern Sudan these have yet to be substantiated. The only four potentially breeding rhino that were in Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic have been moved to a private sanctuary in Kenya in the hope that the move to a more natural environment and natural diet and mixing with Southern White Rhino will encourage these animals to breed. However, due to a small effective founder number of only 1.71 (due to inter-relatedness of remaining animals) and based on Vortex modelling, in the absence of&#160; finding any additional rhino in the wild, this subspecies is highly unlikely to be viable in the longer term. Unless some more Northern White Rhino are found in the wild, it appears that the best that can currently be hoped for is to conserve as many adaptive Northern White Rhino genes as possible for eventual reintroduction back to the wild, but this will require inter-crossing with Southern White Rhino. &#160;</p>","assessor":"Emslie, R.","evaluator":"Knight, M.H. & Adcock , K."},{"scientific_name":null,"primary":false,"kingdom":"PLANTAE","phylum":"TRACHEOPHYTA","class":"MAGNOLIOPSIDA","order":"MAGNOLIALES","family":"MAGNOLIACEAE","genus":"Magnolia ","species":"emarginata","authority":"Howard","infra_name":null,"infra_rank":null,"infra_authority":null,"stock_name":null,"species_id":193950,"main_common_name":"Caimoni","modified_year":2014,"category":"EN","criteria":"B1ab(i,iii)","assessmentid":"2291933","trend_id":2,"biome_marine":false,"biome_freshwater":false,"biome_terrestrial":true,"taxonomicnotes":null,"rationale":"The extent of occurrence of this species is estimated to be less than 2,857 km<sup>2</sup> and it is known from at most five locations.

Mediterranean fisheries are characterized as multi-species fisheries, and in addition to being directly targeted this species is retained as bycatch, particularly in Hake and Red Mullet fisheries, both of which are considered largely overexploited throughout the region. Overexploitation of<em> T. capelanus </em>has been observed as early as 1988, in the Straits of Sicily. In the Adriatic Sea <em>T. capelanus</em> is also experiencing high fishing pressure, which has caused significant reductions in total length (maximum observed size of 21.5 cm, vs. maximum recorded size of 32 cm) and a low proportion of specimens older than three years old catches. This species has a maximum observed age of six years and is likely sexually mature by ages one to two, however age of first maturity has not been confirmed.
