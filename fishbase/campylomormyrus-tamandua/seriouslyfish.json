It\u2019s primarily a benthic (bottom-dwelling) species."],"maintenance":["","This nocturnal species prefers a dimly lit tank, and floating plants are a good idea to diffuse the light further. Stones, roots and plants can all be used to provide shade and cover, too. If kept in a brightly-lit tank the fish will be skittish and may jump. A sand base is essential, as it will probe the substrate with its snout in the hunt for food. Filtration over peat will help to mimic its natural waters, as will creating some water flow in the tank."],"diet":["","It will take frozen and live foods such as bloodworm, brine shrimp, earthworms, tubifex etc. Dried foods are rarely, if ever taken."],"behaviour":["","C. tamandua doesn\u2019t mix well with other mormyrids, including its own kind, but can be kept with many other similarly-sized species that can look after themselves. It should not be kept with very fast-swimming fish however, as it will be easily outcompeted for food. Suggested tankmates include larger Synodontis catfish and peaceful cichlids. In such a community, it\u2019s best kept as a single specimen."],"reproduction":["","It almost certainly hasn\u2019t been bred in aquaria."],"create_time":1426710803.36427}
