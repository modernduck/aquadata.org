Most of the ones in the trade are mass-produced on commercial farms in the Far East or Eastern Europe."],"habitat":["","Often found inhabiting areas of flooded grassland in low-lying coastal areas."],"maintenance":["","Provide a well planted setup with bits of bogwood, driftwood or mopani wood to provide cover and spawning sites for these fish."],"diet":["","It\u2019s naturally a micropredator, foraging for worms, insects and other invertebrates in the wild. Anomala should take dry foods, in which case a meaty Cichlid pellet should be fed as staple food. Make sure diet is supplemented with both vegetative matter (vegetable/spirulina flakes or small pieces of cucumber) and frozen/live foods (of which the Anomala will prefer bloodworm and brineshrimp)."],"behaviour":["","Very peaceful dwarf Cichlid. Can be kept in a community with most other peaceful fish. Female can be very aggressive indeed when protecting her fry, so if the Nannacara Anomala start breeding in a community tank you may have problems."],"reproduction":["","Very simple. In merely adequate water conditions, a single male and female will very likely breed. Breeding is even easier in a larger tank with a number of females providing companionship to a single male. Females require \u201csub-territories\u201d of at least 40cm x 40cm on the bottom of a tank, so a 30\u2033 tank would be required to house two females with a male."],"create_time":1426712810.65285}
