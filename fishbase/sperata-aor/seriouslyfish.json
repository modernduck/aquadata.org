Very large pieces of driftwood, or enormous rocks can be used, and should be arranged to provide areas of shelter. It also appreciates a soft, sandy substrate and dim lighting."],"diet":["","It is quite an unfussy feeder, and will accept dried pelleted, live, and meaty frozen foods. Larger specimens can be offered whole fresh or frozen fish, such as trout or sprats."],"behaviour":["","Not only will it eat any fish it can fit in its capacious mouth, but it is territorial with its own kind, and is thus best kept alone in all but the very largest aquaria. In such a setting, possible tankmates include Pangasius spp., pacus and other tankbusting fish."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in captivity. Reports suggest that the fish exhibit a remarkable breeding behaviour in nature, in which the eggs are incubated, and the fry initially fed, within specially adapted skin on the belly of the male."],"create_time":1426713848.11277}
