Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","Like others in the\u00a0genus\u00a0this\u00a0species\u00a0does best under fairly dim lighting. You can add aquatic plant\u00a0species\u00a0that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, especially\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp.,\u00a0is also useful.","Filtration need not be too strong, with an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or similar adequate, and since this species tends to be maintained in pairs (see \u2018Behaviour and Compatibility\u2019) a filter may not be required at all provided the fish are not overfed and maintenance is stringent.","The latter must include small weekly water changes of 5-10 % aquarium volume with irregular or larger changes not recommended.","All\u00a0Parosphromenus\u00a0spp.\u00a0require acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","There is no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","It goes without saying that these are fishes are sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria."],"diet":["This species is chiefly a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny\u00a0aquatic\u00a0invertebrates, therefore in the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it must be offered a variety of small live foods such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, mosquito larvae, micro worm, etc.","Frozen foods are sometimes accepted but not considered sufficiently-nutritious while the majority of dried products are normally refused."],"behaviour":["Not recommended for the general\u00a0community\u00a0aquarium for reasons already touched upon.","It\u2019s care requirements, disposition, and especially conservation status dictate that it should be maintained alone or alongside a group of small, peaceful cyprinids such as\u00a0Boraras\u00a0or\u00a0Sundadanio\u00a0spp.","Likewise, different\u00a0Parosphromenus\u00a0spp. should not be kept together since the females of many are very difficult to tell apart and some are undoubtedly capable of hybridising.","A mixed-sex group can be maintained if you wish although most breeders prefer to maintain it in sexed pairs since some fry may survive alongside their parents but not usually if other adults are present."],"reproduction":["Normally spawns in small caves or among leaf litter and forms temporary pair bonds with the male solely responsible for egg and brood-care.","Parosphromenus\u00a0spp. have been grouped arbitrarily\u00a0based on courtship behaviour in males which adopt a \u2018head-down\u2019, \u2018head-up\u2019, or \u2018horizontal\u2019 position depending on species.","P. deissneri\u00a0sometimes displays the former posture in which the male assumes a near-vertical position with the head lowermost and fins splayed during nuptial displays but also often adopts a more horizontal shape.","Sexually-active males form small territories at the centre of which is a small cave normally formed from leaf litter in nature, although in aquaria any suitable structure may be chosen (see \u2018Maintenance\u2019).","They then attempt to attract females in the vicinity to enter the cave via spectacular displays as described above.","Eggs and milt are released in batches during a series of embraces in which the male wraps its body around that of the female.","Some males construct a rudimentary bubble nest inside the cave while others do not, but either way both male and female attempt to attach the eggs to the ceiling after they are released.","Subsequent spawning embraces may dislodge eggs from the roof of the cave, and inexperienced adults sometimes simply eat them so a degree of patience may be required until the fish get things right.","Following a successful spawn the female leaves the cave and proceeds to defend the surrounding area while the male tends to the brood.","Incubation is normally 24-36 hours with the fry mobile around 4-6 days later.","They initially swim without direction and the male will collect and return them to the \u2018nest\u2019 but after 3-5 additional days are fully free-swimming and leave the cave at which point parental care ceases.","They may require\u00a0Paramecium, rotifers or similar as a first food but are quickly able to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii and suchlike.","If the aquarium is well-structured they can often be raised alongside the parents but in more basic set-ups should be removed and grown on elsewhere."],"create_time":1426713192.29577}
