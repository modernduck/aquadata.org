locality is \u2018Swamp near Port Bouet, 18 kilometers from Abidjan, 5\u00b015\u2019N, 3\u00b058\u2019W, southern Ivory Coast\u2019, and this species is currently known from\u00a0southwestern Ghana, southern C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and southern Liberia.","The form from Monrovia, Liberia, is usually referred to the putative subspecies\u00a0E. dageti monroviae\u00a0in aquarium literature (see \u2018Notes\u2019).","When a population is known aquarists also tend to label the fish as such in order to avoid hybridisation and preserve bloodlines, e.g., Aboisso, Awiebo, Grand Bassam, Nikawanta, Port Bouet, San Pedro, etc.","Populations of E. d. monroviae include Monrovia, Harbel, Robertsport and Tabou."],"habitat":["Typically occurs in swampy zones of the coastal savanna across its range and has been collected alongside the congeners\u00a0Epiplatys bifasciatus and\u00a0Epiplatys etzeli\u00a0as well as\u00a0Aplocheilichthys rancureli.","Most habitats are freshwater although it also occurs in brackish conditions at some localities."],"maintenance":["Perhaps looks best in a heavily-planted set-up or natural-style arrangement comprising a sandy substrate plus some driftwood roots and branches.","The addition of dried leaf litter would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering additional cover for the fish brings with it the growth of microbe colonies as decomposition occurs.","These can provide a valuable secondary food source for fry and the humic substances released by the decaying leaves are also considered beneficial, with alder cones also useful in this respect.","There\u2019s no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting but you can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, such as\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also appreciated."],"diet":["Probably a\u00a0predator\u00a0feeding on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc.","Small insects such as crickets or\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0fruit flies are also suitable to use although it\u2019s best to fill the stomachs of these by feeding them fish flakes or some kind of vegetable matter before offering them to the fish."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species and can make an excellent resident of the well-chosen community.","Many similarly-sized characids, cyprinids, anabantoids, callicthyids, loricariids are compatible and since it spends much of its time in the upper part of the water column certain cichlids are suitable as well.","Try to buy 6 or more specimens since it\u2019s relatively gregarious and the fish will not only be less shy but display more interesting behaviour when maintained in larger groups."],"reproduction":["Relatively easy to breed and in a well-decorated, mature species set-up fry may begin to appear without further intervention.","If the adults are being maintained in a community tank, however, it\u2019s best to organise a separate aquarium for breeding purposes.","This can be very simple provided it contains a suitable medium for the fish to deposit their eggs in with\u00a0Riccia,\u00a0Taxiphylum\u00a0spp. mosses, the roots of floating plants or woollen spawning mops all equally suitable, and if filtration is desired a small air-driven sponge-type unit is best.","Most breeders use a pair or single male plus two or more females with some preferring to remove and replace the medium every few days, incubating and hatching the eggs elsewhere, while others simply leave everything\u00a0in situ\u00a0until free-swimming fry can be seen near the water surface.","Adults do predate eggs and fry so if the intention is to raise good numbers it\u2019s wise to separate them.","Incubation is around 11-14 days at 21 \u00b0C/69.8 \u00b0F with cooler temperatures between 21-23 \u00b0C/69.8-73.4 \u00b0F apparently favouring a relatively even sex ratio, while higher values result in more males than females.","Provided the plants used are mature the fry are usually able to survive on the microorganisms which are present naturally, and a dried leaf or two can be added which will also promote the growth of such animals.","If raising the fry in more sterile conditions they initially require microscopic foods such as rotifers until large enough to accept\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii and suchlike.","It\u2019s important to omit larger invertebrates such as snails or shrimp from the breeding tank as they will consume\u00a0eggs."],"create_time":1426711659.63882}
