{"images":{"src":"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/astyanax_leopoldi_1-288x135.jpg"},"distribution":"Native to the Approuague and Oyapock river basins in French Guiana and northwestern Brazil.","habitat":"It is most common in fast flowing waters, where it can be found swimming in large shoals in marginal or otherwise ?\u00a0calmer areas.","maintenance":"Quite adaptable. It will thrive in a stream-type setup with a gravel substrate, smooth stones and a good amount of water flow. It is equally happy in an Amazon-style arrangement?\u00a0or heavily-planted tank, though. Given its natural habitat, assume good oxygenation to be key for its long term survival.","diet":"Apparently preys on invertebrates and smaller fishes in nature. Its captive diet should contain plenty of small live and frozen morsels alongside good quality dried foods.","behaviour":"Very peaceful and suitable for many community tanks. Don\u2019t keep it with anything very large or aggressive. Good tankmates include small characins, dwarf cichlids and peaceful catfishes from the families Callichthyidae and Loricariidae. It\u2019s a schooling?\u00a0species by nature, so buy a group of at least 8-10.","reproduction":"Has apparently been bred in captivity but we\u2019ve been unable to obtain any specifics thus far.","create_time":1426710321.08339}
