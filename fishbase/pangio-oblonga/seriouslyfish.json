The water has a negligible dissolved mineral content, is poorly-buffered and\u00a0pH\u00a0can be as low as 3.0 or 4.0 due to release of tannins and\u00a0organic\u00a0acids from decaying organic material.","Depending on locality the\u00a0substrate\u00a0may be composed of\u00a0peat, mud or\u00a0sand\u00a0with the fish typically abundant in piles of leaf litter."],"maintenance":["Use a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0since this\u00a0species\u00a0likes to dig and tends to spend some of its time completely buried. When coarser\u00a0gravel\u00a0is used it may become stressed or damage itself, and feeding behaviour can be inhibited.","A few driftwood roots and branches, placed in such a way that plenty of shady spots are formed, can be used to add structure to the display and addition of dried leaf litter would provide additional cover and aid in simulating natural conditions.","Fairly dim lighting is also preferable with aquatic plants from genera such as Microsorum, Taxiphyllum, and Cryptocoryne suitable.","Gentle filtration providing a little surface agitation is adequate and high flow rates best avoided. Ensure that small specimens are unable to enter\u00a0filter\u00a0intakes and cover the\u00a0tank\u00a0well as most loaches do jump at times, especially when introduced to a new environment."],"diet":["Chiefly a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0sifting mouthfuls of\u00a0substrate\u00a0through the mouth and gills from which insect\u00a0larvae, small crustaceans and suchlike are extracted with a proportion of the natural diet also likely to comprise organic detritus and plant material from the gut contents of prey.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept sinking dried foods but should also be offered regular meals of live and frozen\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0bloodworm, micro worm, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Pangio\u00a0spp. are peaceful both with one another and other fishes and there exist no reports of them harming tankmates though they may prey on eggs or\u00a0fry.","In nature they\u2019re often found in large aggregations and in captivity will often pack themselves into a single nook, cranny or cave when at rest, so a group of at least 5-6 specimens should be the minimum purchased.","Small, peaceful species from similar environments such as Boraras, Sundadanio, smaller Rasbora, Trichopsis, Sphaerichthys, Kottelatlimia, etc., constitute the best tankmates.","Some sand-dwelling loaches from the family Nemacheilidae are also suitable but proper research is essential as some can be excessively competitive, territorial or otherwise aggressive."],"reproduction":["There exists at least one documented account of this species being bred in aquaria, though not under controlled conditions.","A number of partially-grown fry were discovered living among a substrate of large-grade gravel and no spawning or courtship behaviour was observed.","The aquarium was\u00a0around 200 litres in volume with pH 7.8 \u2013 8.0, gH 18 \u2013 22, kH above 20 and temperature 78 \u2013 80 \u00b0F/25.6 \u2013 26.7 \u00b0C."],"create_time":1426713099.69635}
