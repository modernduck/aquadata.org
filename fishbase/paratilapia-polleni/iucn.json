It qualifies as Vulnerable on account of its limited distribution (extent of occurrence is less than 20,000 km\u00b2) and fragmented habitat (mainly due to deforestation of river catchments) which are causing a continued decline in available habitat and the number of mature individuals in the population.","assessor":"Loiselle, P. & participants of the CBSG/ANGAP CAMP \"Faune de Madagascar\" workshop, Mantasoa, Madagascar 2001","evaluator":"Stiassny, M.L.J., Sparks, J.S.
