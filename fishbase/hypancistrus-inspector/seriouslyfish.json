Casiquiare, Amazonas, Venezuela\u2019."],"habitat":"Normally collected from rocky rapids.","maintenance":["Not difficult to maintain under the correct conditions; we strongly recommend keeping it in a\u00a0tank\u00a0designed to simulate a flowing stream with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel, and some water-worn boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood branches, terracotta pipes, plant pots, etc., arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies, and shaded spots, thus providing broken lines of sight.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires spotless water in order to thrive, therefore weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should also be considered routine.","Though torrent-like conditions are unnecessary it does best if there is a high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and some water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0meaning power\u00a0filter(s), additional\u00a0powerhead(s), or airstone(s) should be employed as necessary."],"diet":["Wild specimens are likely omnivorous but with a preference for aquatic\u00a0invertebrates and suchlike.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it does best when offered a varied diet comprising sinking dried foods,\u00a0frozen\u00a0Daphnia, mosquito larvae, chironomid larvae (bloodworm), and prawn/shrimp, for, example, plus some fresh fruit, parboiled potato, etc.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients bound with gelatin are very useful since they can be tailored to contain fresh vegetables,\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0and meatier ingredients."],"behaviour":"A peaceful species which can be maintained in a well-chosen community but should not be maintained alongside other Hypancistrus spp. in order to prevent hybridisation.","reproduction":"Has been bred in aquaria. It\u2019s a cave-spawner with the male responsible for brood care.","create_time":1426712105.88294}
