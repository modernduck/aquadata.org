However it will thrive in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0gravel\u00a0and some larger, water-worn boulders.","This\u00a0can be further furnished with driftwood roots and branches plus aquatic plants\u00a0from genera such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0which can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor. Bright lighting will promote the growth of\u00a0algae\u00a0upon which the fish will\u00a0graze.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running water it\u2019s quite intolerant to the accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and does best\u00a0if there is a high level of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and moderate water movement."],"diet":["Primarily an\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0grazer feeding on\u00a0algae, small crustaceans, insect\u00a0larvae, etc., and for it to develop its best colours and condition it should be offered regular meals of small live and frozen foods such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia\u00a0and\u00a0Artemia,\u00a0along with good quality dried flakes, granules and fresh plant material.","Shelled peas, cucumber, blanched courgette, spinach, and chopped fruit all make good additions to the menu, and home-made, gel-based foods using a mixture of natural ingredients are also highly recommended.","Once settled\u00a0it will often ascend into midwater to feed and in a stream-style set-up as described above will be seen browsing the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0that tends to form on the rockwork."],"behaviour":["Though normally sold as such this\u00a0species\u00a0is largely unsuitable for the general\u00a0community aquarium. This does not mean to say it must be kept alone, rather that tankmates must be chosen with care.","While small specimens tend to hide away much of the time they become increasingly\u00a0territorial\u00a0as they grow and can display particularly high levels of aggression towards similar-looking \u00a0fishes such as Crossocheilus, Epalzeorhynchos, or Garra spp.","Other bottom-dwelling fishes including cichlids and most catfishes are best avoided as they may be picked on it may even\u00a0attach itself to the flanks of larger tankmates in order to feed on their body mucus.","For the upper levels choose\u00a0robust, active cyprinids, characids, or similar. Ideally it\u00a0should be the final addition to the\u00a0tank\u00a0in order to avoid it claiming ownership of the entire space.","Keeping a group is one way to reduce intraspecific\u00a0aggression but at least half-a-dozen or more individuals should be purchased because they will develop a distinct pecking order and in lesser numbers weaker individuals are more easily targeted. It goes without saying that a very large tank would be needed in order to attempt such a project."],"reproduction":"As far as we know it hasn\u2019t been bred in aquaria but is farmed for the trade in large numbers with the aid of hormones.","create_time":1426711885.25838}
