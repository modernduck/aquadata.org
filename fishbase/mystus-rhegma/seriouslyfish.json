Long-leaved plants such as Vallisneria would simulate one of its natural habitats. You will see it more often if the surface is covered in floating plants to cut down the light reaching the substrate."],"diet":["","Like most of its congeners, M. rhegma is an unfussy feeder accepting most small live, frozen and dried foods. Try to keep the diet varied."],"behaviour":["","A peaceful and gregarious species but it will probably eat small fish when adult. It makes a good bottom dweller for communities of larger peaceful fish, such as larger rasboras, barbs, anabantoids and peaceful cichlids. It can be kept in a small group in a suitably large tank."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in aquaria."],"create_time":1426712792.68894}
