locality is given simply as \u2018Colombia\u2019 and this species is widespread in the R\u00edo Magdalena drainage, Colombia including its major tributary the R\u00edo Cauca.","It\u2019s also known from the R\u00edo Sin\u00fa drainage, northwestern Colombia and R\u00edo Lim\u00f3n basin, northwestern Venezuela.","The latter forms part of the Lago de Maracaibo (Lake Maracaibo), feeding into it close to the Caribbean Sea at the town of San Rafael de El Mojan.","Lago de Maracaibo has been heavily drilled for oil and is now becoming chronically polluted due to a high number of leaks which remain unrepaired following the withdrawal of the majority of maintenance operations plus additional contamination from agriculture and the settlements built around it."],"habitat":"Occurs in various habitat-types but mostly forested streams and tributaries with sandy substrates plus associated backwaters.","maintenance":["The most essential item of d\u00e9cor is a soft, sandy\u00a0substrate\u00a0so that the fish can browse naturally (see \u2018Diet\u2019).","Coarser materials such as\u00a0gravel\u00a0or small pebbles can inhibit feeding, damage\u00a0gill\u00a0filaments and even be ingested with the potential of internal damage or blockages.","Additional furnishings are as much a case of personal taste as anything else but the most favoured set-ups tend to feature relatively dim lighting plus some chunks of driftwood and scattered roots or branches.","Leaf litter is a typical feature of the natural environment but not really recommended in aquaria because the feeding behaviour of\u00a0Geophagus\u00a0spp. tends to cause an excess of partially-decomposed material in suspension which not only looks unsightly but can block\u00a0filter\u00a0and\u00a0pump mechanisms.","One or two flattish, water-worn rocks can also be included to provide potential\u00a0spawning\u00a0sites if you wish.","Water quality is of the utmost importance since these cichlids are extremely susceptible to deteriorating water quality and swings in chemical parameters so should never be introduced to a biologically immature\u00a0aquarium.","The best way to achieve the desired stability is to over-filter\u00a0the\u00a0tank\u00a0using a combination of external canister filters and/or a\u00a0sump\u00a0system and perform minimum weekly water changes of 50-70%.","If the maintenance regime is insufficient health issues such as\u00a0head and lateral line erosion\u00a0or\u00a0stunted\u00a0growth can occur.","Mechanical filtration\u00a0should also be tailored to trap small particles stirred up by the fish as\u00a0sand\u00a0can cause blockages and wearing issues with\u00a0filter\u00a0mechanisms if allowed to continually run through the system.","High flow rates should be avoided so position\u00a0filter\u00a0returns accordingly."],"diet":["\u2018Geophagus\u2018 steindachneri group spp. are benthophagous by nature and mostly employ a feeding strategy whereby mouthfuls of substrate are taken and sifted for edible items with the remaining material expelled via the gills and mouth.","For this reason they\u2019re commonly termed \u2018eartheaters\u2019 and the provision of a suitable\u00a0substrate\u00a0is essential to their long-term well-being.","Once settled they readily rise into the\u00a0water column\u00a0when food is introduced but continue to browse normally at other times.","The stomach contents of wild specimens mostly comprise small\u00a0aquatic\u00a0and terrestrial invertebrates, plant material in the form of seeds,\u00a0organic\u00a0detritus\u00a0and sediment.","Even as adults these cichlids seem unable to properly ingest larger food items meaning the diet should contain a variety of high quality, fine-grade prepared foods plus small live or frozen bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, mosquito\u00a0larvae, etc.","At least some of the dried products should contain a high proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, for example, are proven to work well and can be cut into bite-sized discs using the end of a sharp pipette or small knife.","Rather than a single large meal offer 3-4 smaller portions daily to allow natural browsing behaviour as this seems to result in the best growth rate and condition."],"behaviour":["Adult males are typically aggressive towards one another, especially when courting or spawning and only one should be housed in all but the largest aquaria.","This species cannot be described as predatory but very small tankmates may nevertheless be eaten."],"reproduction":"Ovophilous, maternal mouthbrooder forming weak pair bonds during the spawning process only.","create_time":1426711820.34049}
