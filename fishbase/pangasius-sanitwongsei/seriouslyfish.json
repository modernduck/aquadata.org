Obviously these conditions are virtually impossible to replicate in the home. Coupled with the massive size of sexually mature fish, it would seem that aquarium breeding is unlikely to be achieved. It\u2019s being bred commercially for food in huge ponds on Far Eastern fish farms, though. Apparently the young fish we see in the hobby come from these same farms."],"create_time":1426713089.34414}
