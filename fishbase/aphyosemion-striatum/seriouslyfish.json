The use of floating plants to further diffuse the light is also recommended.","This species is an accomplished jumper so the cover must fit tightly."],"diet":["Aphyosemion species feed largely on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates in the wild.","In captivity small live or frozen foods such as Daphnia\u00a0or bloodworm are preferred although the fish will also accept good quality flake in most cases."],"behaviour":["A. striatum can be kept in a community\u00a0arrangement provided tankmates are chosen with care. This is a very peaceful, relatively shy species and will easily be out-competed by more vigorous fishes.","Ideal choices include tetras, cyprinids, dwarf cichlids, Corydoras\u00a0catfishes, small Loricariids and peaceful Anabantoids which grow large enough to avoid being eaten."],"reproduction":["A number of different methods have proven successful for\u00a0spawning\u00a0Aphyosemion species in aquaria, and much is down to personal preference.\u00a0It is often recommended that a\u00a0trio comprising a single male and two females should be used, but brood sizes tend to be lower under these circumstances, and it can also be bred using a single pair.","Many breeders do not use filtration, but the use of a small, air-driven sponge filter to prevent stagnation is advisable. Water should be around neutral in terms of chemistry,\u00a0with a temperature within the range suggested above.\u00a0There is no need to use artificial lighting.","The fish should be conditioned on a varied diet of live and frozen foods, and it is best to keep males and females apart during this process in order that females are not forced to spawn continuously. Select the best male and plumpest female before placing them in the spawning\u00a0aquarium.","A. striatum\u00a0deposits eggs either in the substrate or clumps of vegetation,\u00a0therefore the spawning medium can either be a layer of peat moss on the floor of the aquarium, clumps of fine-leaved plants such as Taxiphylum,\u00a0or artificial spawning mops. That said, a bare set-up with spawning mops is practical\u00a0for both ease of maintenance and egg collection.","Eggs are deposited in daily\u00a0batches of 20-30 for around 2 weeks, and these should be removed gently as they are noticed. Each pair should only be allowed to spawn for a week or so because\u00a0the spawning process is hard on the fish, particularly the female.","Once removed, the eggs can be incubated either in water or by placing them on a damp layer of peat moss in a small plastic container. Fungussed eggs should be removed as they are noticed.","If incubating in water, the eggs can be transferred to a small aquarium\u00a0filled\u00a0to a depth of 1-2 inches from the spawning aquarium, to which has been added 1-3 drops of methylene blue depending on volume. Since the eggs are very sensitive to light this should be maintained in\u00a0darkness. The eggs will hatch in 10-14 days depending on temperature.","If incubating on peat moss, place the container in a warm, dark place and simply leave it for around 18 days. If breeding\u00a0several species or multiple broods, it is a good idea to label each container with the date, hatching date, species and number of eggs. Hatching can usually be induced by simply placing the eggs in water, but if this fails, blowing gently into the water through a straw or piece of airline, or placing\u00a0the eggs into a small container and carrying this in your pocket for a few hours\u00a0may help.","The fry are tiny and initial food should be infusoria grade. If using the peat moss incubation method, the aquarium in which the fry will grow\u00a0can be \u2018seeded\u2019 a few days prior to hatching by adding a couple of drops of liquifry or green water. Otherwise add small amounts as required. After 2 days the fry can be\u00a0offered Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0microworm, etc. The water must initially be kept very shallow but the level can be raised as the fry grow.","Extreme care must be taken regarding water quality in the raising tank as the fry are very susceptible to Piscinoodinium parasites (velvet disease). They should be fed twice a day with small water changes every 2-3 days for optimal growth."],"create_time":1426710181.19155}
