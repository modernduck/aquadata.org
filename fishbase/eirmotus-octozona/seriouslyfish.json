The\u00a0swamps in this area have been severely disturbed with many of the original habitats destroyed so the current status of many\u00a0species inhabiting them is best described as unclear.","Records from Borneo probably refer to the congener\u00a0E. insignis."],"habitat":"Unconfirmed. Other members of the genus variously inhabit shady, slow-moving forest streams with dense marginal vegetation, leaf litter or mud substrates and slightly acidic water, and heavily-vegetated swamps (E. insignis), peat swamp forests (E. furvus), or flood plains and the margins of lakes (E. isthmus).","maintenance":["Will thrive in a heavily-planted or\u00a0forest stream-type\u00a0set-up, the latter comprising a soft\u00a0substrate, dim lighting, roots, branches and leaf litter as d\u00e9cor. You could also add\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants\u00a0that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp. Filtration does not need to be particularly strong as it mostly hails from sluggish waters.","Eirmotus\u00a0species\u00a0can be tricky to acclimatise to captive\u00a0life as they often arrive in poor condition and seem sensitive to fluctuating water chemistry. Never introduce them to biologically-immature aquaria and perform small, regular water changes of around 10%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume."],"diet":["Likely to feed on small invertebrates, algae and other zooplankton in nature. In the aquarium it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should not be fed these exclusively. Daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as Daphnia, Artemia and suchlike will result in optimal\u00a0colouration and encourage the fish to come into breeding condition.","This species can be quite weak on import and small live foods are highly recommended as an initial diet, introducing the dry and frozen products as the fish become settled. It\u2019s also noted as something of a shy, even reluctant, feeder."],"behaviour":["Unsuitable for most\u00a0community\u00a0aquaria as it may be intimidated or outcompeted for food by larger or more boisterous tankmates. Small, peaceful cyprinids such as\u00a0Trigonostigma\u00a0or\u00a0Boraras\u00a0species\u00a0are suitable companions and we suspect it will also do ok with many small South American characins,\u00a0Otocinclus\u00a0or pygmy\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0catfishes.","Accommodating it in a biotope-style community of Malaysian species is also a possibility with some of the more suitable ones including Trigonostigma heteromorpha, Boraras maculatus, Brachydanio albolineata, B. kerri, Puntigrus\u00a0partipentazona, Brevibora dorsiocellata, Trigonopoma gracile, T. pauciperforatum, and\u00a0Acanthopsoides molobrion\u00a0plus\u00a0various\u00a0Nemacheilus, Pangio, and Homalopteroides\u00a0spp.","It\u2019s a shoaling species by nature and really should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens. Maintaining it in such numbers will not only make the fish less nervous but result in a more effective, natural-looking display. Males will also display more intense\u00a0colours and some interesting behaviour as they compete with one other for female attention."],"reproduction":"Unrecorded as far as we know.","create_time":1426711630.68252}
