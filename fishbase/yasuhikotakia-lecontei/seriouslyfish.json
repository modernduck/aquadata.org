These have an added benefit as they can be attached to pieces of d\u00e9cor in such a way as to provide useful shade.","Otherwise be sure to provide plenty of cover as\u00a0Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp. are inquisitive and seems to enjoy exploring their surroundings. Rocks, wood, flower pots and\u00a0aquarium\u00a0ornaments can be used in whichever combination to achieve the desired effect.","Bear in mind that they like to squeeze themselves into small gaps and crevices so items with sharp edges should be omitted, and any gaps or holes small enough for a fish to become trapped should be filled in with\u00a0aquarium-grade silicone sealant. A tightly-fitting cover is also essential as these loaches do jump at times.","Although botiids don\u2019t require turbulent conditions they do best when the water is well-oxygenated with a degree of flow, are intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water in order to thrive.","For these reasons they should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapt most readily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria. In terms of maintenance weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["While\u00a0Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp. appear to be chiefly\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0they will also eat\u00a0vegetative\u00a0matter if available, often including soft-leaved\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants. The natural diet consists primarily of aquatic molluscs and other benthic invertebrates.","They\u2019re largely unfussy feeders but must be offered a varied diet comprising quality dried products, live or frozen\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, etc., plus fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach, or courgette.","Home-made foods using a mixture of natural ingredients and bound with gelatin are also highly recommended.","Chopped earthworm can also provide a useful source of protein but should be used sparingly, and while most botiids also prey on\u00a0aquatic\u00a0snails though should never be considered the answer to an infestation since they\u2019re not\u00a0obligate\u00a0molluscivores.","Once settled into an\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they\u2019re bold feeders and often rise into midwater at meal times."],"behaviour":["Several SF members have experience with this species and all report it to be milder in temperament than some congeners such as Y. eos and Y. morleti.","That said slow-moving or long-finned fishes are best omitted with active,\u00a0pelagic\u00a0cyprinids such as many\u00a0Devario,\u00a0Rasbora, \u2018Puntius\u2018,\u00a0and some\u00a0Danio\u00a0spp. representing more suitable tankmates.","In terms of other bottom-dwellers it should coexist relatively peacefully with most\u00a0Botia\u00a0and\u00a0Syncrossus\u00a0spp. or in very large tanks,\u00a0Chromobotia macracanthus. Some cobitid and nemacheilid loaches are also possibilities as are members of\u00a0Epalzeorhynchos,\u00a0Crossocheilus,\u00a0Garra, and many catfishes.","As always, thorough research prior to selecting a\u00a0community\u00a0of fishes is the best way to avoid potential problems.","Yasuhikotakia\u00a0spp.\u00a0are\u00a0gregarious, form complex social hierarchies and should be maintained in groups of at least 5 or 6 specimens, preferably 10 or more.","When kept singly they can become withdrawn or even aggressive towards similarly-shaped fishes, and if only a\u00a0pair\u00a0or trio are purchased the dominant individual may\u00a0stress the other(s) to the extent that they stop feeding.","That said they seemingly require regular contact with conspecifics, a fact exemplied by a number of behavioural rituals which have been recorded consistently in aquaria (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"reproduction":["No reports of breeding in private aquaria exist but some Yasuhikotakia species are farmed commercially for the hobby via the use of hormones (Y. lecontei is not one of them as far as we know).","In the Mekong basin spawning occurs at the onset of the wet season when adults migrate into tributary drainages where the juveniles remain in the early stages of life, dispersing into perennial channels in November/December when the flow in the tributaries begins to recede. Juveniles also have a series of dark, vertical bars on the flanks which fade as they reach maturity."],"create_time":1426714268.56573}
