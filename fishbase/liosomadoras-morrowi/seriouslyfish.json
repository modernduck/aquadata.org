Plenty of cover should also be provided, particularly if you\u2019re keeping several fish together. Smooth rocks, driftwood, lengths of pvc piping and plants that can survive under low levels of light, such as Anubias sp., java fern and Vallisneria can all be used."],"diet":["","Unfussy. It relishes live and frozen foods such as bloodworm, earthworms etc., as well as sinking dried foods. Add food after lights out to ensure it receives its share."],"behaviour":["","Peaceful and shy, but will eat small fish during the hours of darkness. Ideally, keep it in a South American biotope aquarium, with similarly-sized characins, cichlids and other peaceful catfish such as Corydoras sp. and Loricariids. It is sometimes territorial with its own kind, but several can be kept in a suitably-sized aquarium if lots of cover is provided."],"reproduction":["","Not thought to have been achieved in aquaria. Fertilisation occurs internally."],"create_time":1426712508.28002}
