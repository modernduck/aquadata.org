The populations are only 10 km apart. Restricted population and small number of localities qualifies the species for threatened categories, however there is no habitat degradation occurring in the are so it cannot be categorized under Vulnerable. Nevertheless, even though currently there are no known threats to the species this area is tourist attraction and even a small habitat modification can become threatening for the species. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","assessor":"Dahanukar, N.","evaluator":"Kar, D, Juffe Bignoli, D., Rema Devi, K.R. & Chaudhry, S."}]
