Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","This species seems to do best under fairly dim lighting. You can add aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp., while floating vegetation, especially\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also useful.","For breeding purposes acidic conditions with negligible carbonate hardness and very low general hardness are required so a reverse osmosis unit or other method of obtaining soft water may need to be employed, and this can be further acidified using phosphoric acid or similar if necessary.","There is no need to use natural peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","It goes without saying that this species is sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria."],"diet":["Probably a\u00a0micropredator\u00a0feeding on tiny invertebrates and other\u00a0zooplankton\u00a0in nature.","In the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered daily meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Moina, grindal worm, etc."],"behaviour":["Peaceful with other species but does not make an ideal\u00a0community\u00a0fish due to its small size and somewhat specialised requirements","Ideally it should be maintained alone or at most with diminutive, non-aggressive\u00a0characids and smaller callichthyid or loricariid catfishes.","It also makes an ideal dither fish\u00a0for\u00a0Apistogramma\u00a0spp. and other dwarf cichlids since \u00a0it tends to inhabit the middle-to-upper regions of the\u00a0tank.","Though\u00a0gregarious\u00a0by nature it\u2019s a shoaling rather than\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0with territorial rival males sparring on a regular basis.","8-10 specimens should be the minimum purchase since the fish will be less shy and display more interesting behaviour."],"reproduction":["Has been achieved and in a properly-structured,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","It apparently practices internal fertilisation with both males and females having distinctive genital papillae, but few details seem to be available."],"create_time":1426714156.13752}
