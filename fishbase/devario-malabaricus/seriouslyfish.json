Kumar, pers. comm.).","The precise extent of its range is only likely to be solved with further study."],"habitat":["Inhabits hill streams and upper parts of small rivers containing clear, well-oxygenated water with substrates of\u00a0gravel\u00a0and\u00a0variably-sized rocks and some\u00a0marginal\u00a0or over-hanging vegetation.","Water flow, volume and turbidity are highly variable depending on time of year, and some populations survive in remnant pools during the dry season.","In the Cauvery River, Karnataka state, southern India sympatric species include Barilius gatensis,\u00a0Puntius bimaculatus, Pethia conchonius, Rasbora daniconius, Schistura semiarmatus,\u00a0Lepidocephalichthys thermalis,\u00a0Aplocheilus blockii,\u00a0A. lineatus,\u00a0A. panchax,\u00a0Badis sp.,\u00a0Channa gachua,\u00a0C. punctata,\u00a0Glossogobius giuris,\u00a0Mastacembelus armatus,\u00a0Oryzias dancena, and\u00a0Parambassis ranga."],"maintenance":["Not difficult to keep in a well-maintained aquarium. It\u2019s likely to thrive in an aquarium set up\u00a0resemble a flowing stream or\u00a0river\u00a0with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized, water-worn rocks,\u00a0sand, fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0and perhaps some small boulders.","This can be further furnished with driftwood roots or branches, and while the majority of\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor.","Since it naturally occurs in pristine habitats it\u2019s probably intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0pollutants and requires more-or-less spotless water in order to thrive.","Though very fast flow is unnecessary it also prefers a relatively high proportion of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and moderate water movement.","Weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0volume should be considered routine, and the\u00a0tank\u00a0must have a very tightly-fitting cover as all\u00a0Devario\u00a0spp. are accomplished jumpers."],"diet":["Almost certain to prey chiefly on insects and their\u00a0larvae\u00a0in nature though in captivity it\u2019s far from selective and easily-fed.","A good quality dried product can be used as the staple diet but this should be supplemented with regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Daphnia,\u00a0Artemia, etc., for the best colouration and conditioning."],"behaviour":["Not an aggressive fish but may upset slow-moving or timid tankmates with its constant activity and vigorous feeding behaviour, and is therefore most appropriate for larger aquaria containing\u00a0robust, similarly-sized fishes.","There are plenty of suitable choices including many cyprinids, loaches, cichlids, catfishes and characins, although as always when selecting a compatible\u00a0community\u00a0of fish proper research is essential.","It\u2019s a\u00a0schooling\u00a0species\u00a0by nature and ideally should be kept in a group of at least 8-10 specimens which will not only make the fish less nervous but result in a more effective, natural looking display.","Any aggression will also be contained as the fish concentrate on maintaining their hierarchical position within the group, and males tend to display better colours in the presence of rivals."],"reproduction":["Like most small cyprinids\u00a0Devario\u00a0spp. are\u00a0egg-scattering free spawners exhibiting no\u00a0parental care.","When in good condition they will\u00a0spawn\u00a0often and in a well-planted,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquarium\u00a0it\u2019s possible that small numbers of\u00a0fry\u00a0may start to appear without intervention.","However if you want to maximise yield a more controlled approach is required.","The adult group can still be conditioned together but a smaller\u00a0tank\u00a0with a\u00a0base\u00a0measuring at least 60 cm x 30 cm should also be set up and filled with\u00a0mature\u00a0water.","This should be very dimly lit and the\u00a0base\u00a0covered with some kind of mesh of a large enough grade so that the eggs can fall through but small enough so that the adults cannot reach them.\u00a0The widely available plastic \u2018grass\u2019-type\u00a0matting can also be used and works well, as does a layer of glass marbles.","Alternatively filling much of the\u00a0tank\u00a0with a fine-leaved plant such as\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0spp. or spawning mops can also return decent results.","The water itself should be of slightly\u00a0acidic\u00a0to\u00a0neutral\u00a0pH\u00a0with a temperature towards the upper end of the range suggested above, and an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or\u00a0air stone(s) should also be included to provide\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and water movement.","When the adults are well-conditioned and the females appear\u00a0gravid\u00a0one or two pairs should then be introduced.","If ready\u00a0spawning\u00a0usually taking place within 24 hours,\u00a0with the female tending to appear noticeably slimmer after the event, and after 48 hours the adults should be removed whether this is observed or not.","Incubation is temperature-dependant to an extent but typically lasts 24-36 hours with the young free-swimming a few days later.","Initial food should be Paramecium or similar, introducing Artemia nauplii, microworm, powdered dry foods, etc. once the fry are large enough to accept them."],"create_time":1426711574.01776}
