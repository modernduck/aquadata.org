{"images":{"src":"http://www.seriouslyfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Syncrossus-helodes-1-288x133.jpg"},"distribution":["Type locality appears to be the Mekong River north of Krati\u00e9 town, Krati\u00e9 province, eastern Cambodia, but the species is currently accepted to range throughout the Mekong drainage in Laos, Cambodia, southern Vietnam, and Thailand.","It\u2019s also known from the Chao Phraya and Mae Khlong river system in central and western Thailand so presumably occurs in the east of the country as well. Body colour and patterning vary somewhat depending on locality (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"habitat":["S. helodes is said to inhabit flowing waters of all sizes from small headwater streams to main river channels, and during the wet season it migrates into flooded areas to feed and spawn.","The fish are therefore found in different habitat-types depending on the time of year, and the habitats themselves also vary; water flow and depth tend to increase significantly during the wet season, for example. Turbidity and pH typically also rise during this time while water temperature drops.","In the Tonl\u00e9 Sap lake and river system, central Cambodia it\u2019s been recorded alongside a number of other fish species including Hampala macrolepidota, Osteochilus hasseltii, Parachela siamensis, Puntius brevis, P. orphoides, Rasbora aurotaenia, R. paviana, R. rubrodorsalis, Yasuhikotakia modesta, Nemacheilus pallidus, Mystus bocourti, M. multiradiatus, Macrognathus semiocellatus, M. siamensis, Parambassis siamensis, Pristolepis fasciata, Anabas testudineus, Trichopodus microlepis, Trichopsis schalleri, and Monotrete cochinchinensis."],"maintenance":["All botiids need a well-structured set-up although the actual choice of d\u00e9cor is more-or-less down to personal taste. A natural-style arrangement could include a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of\u00a0sand/fine\u00a0gravel\u00a0with lots of smooth, water-worn rocks and pebbles plus one or two lumps of driftwood or twisted roots/branches.","Lighting can be relatively subdued and plants able to grow in such conditions like\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum barbieri,\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be added if you wish. These have an added benefit as they can be attached to pieces of d\u00e9cor in such a way as to provide useful shade.","Otherwise be sure to provide plenty of cover as\u00a0Syncrossus\u00a0spp. are inquisitive and seems to enjoy exploring their surroundings. Rocks, wood, flower pots and\u00a0aquarium\u00a0ornaments can be used in whichever combination to achieve the desired effect.","Bear in mind that these loaches like to squeeze themselves into small gaps and crevices so items with sharp edges should be omitted, and any gaps/holes small enough for a fish to become trapped should be filled in with\u00a0aquarium-grade silicone sealant. A tightly-fitting cover is also essential as they may also jump at times.","Although botiids don\u2019t require the very turbulent conditions favoured by many balitorids/nemacheilids they do best when the water is well-oxygenated with a degree of flow, are intolerant to accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes, and requires spotless water in order to thrive. For this reason they should never be introduced to biologically immature set-ups and adapt most easily to stable,\u00a0mature\u00a0aquaria. In terms of maintenance weekly water changes of 30-50%\u00a0tank\u00a0volume should be considered routine."],"diet":["While\u00a0Syncrossus\u00a0spp. appear to be chiefly\u00a0carnivorous\u00a0by nature they will also eat\u00a0vegetative\u00a0matter if available, sometimes including soft-leaved\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants.","They\u2019re largely unfussy feeders but should be offered a varied diet comprising quality dried products, live/frozen\u00a0bloodworm,\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, etc. plus fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach, or courgette.","Chopped earthworm can also provide a useful source of protein but should be used sparingly, while home-made, gel-based foods using a mixture of natural ingredients are highly recommended. They\u2019ll also prey on\u00a0aquatic\u00a0snails but should not be considered the answer to an infestation since if other options are available they will take them. Once settled into an\u00a0aquarium\u00a0they\u2019re bold feeders, often rising into midwater."],"behaviour":["Can be belligerent and should not be kept with much smaller fishes as they may be intimidated by its size and sometimes very active behaviour. Slow-moving, long-finned\u00a0species\u00a0such as ornamental bettas, guppies, and many cichlids should also be avoided as trailing fins can be nipped.","More suitable choices are fast-moving,\u00a0pelagic\u00a0cyprinids such as many\u00a0Devario,\u00a0Rasbora, \u2018Puntius\u2018,\u00a0Mystacoleucus, and some\u00a0Danio\u00a0spp., while in larger tanks the\u00a0genera\u00a0Barilius,\u00a0Luciosoma,\u00a0Balantiocheilos, and\u00a0Barbonymus\u00a0are options.","In terms of bottom-dwellers it\u2019s often said to do well alongside other\u00a0robust\u00a0botiid\u00a0species\u00a0though experiences tend to vary with some reporting excessive aggression. Some cobitid/nemacheilid loaches are also possibilities as are members of\u00a0Epalzeorhynchos,\u00a0Crossocheilus, and\u00a0Garra\u00a0plus many non-territorial\u00a0catfishes. As always, thorough research prior to selecting a\u00a0community\u00a0of fishes is the best way to avoid problems.","These loaches are\u00a0gregarious, form complex social hierarchies and should be maintained in groups of at least 5 or 6 specimens, preferably 10 or more. When kept singly they can become withdrawn or aggressive towards similarly-shaped fishes, and if only a\u00a0pair\u00a0or trio are purchased the dominant individual will typically attack the other(s) repeatedly and may prevent them from feeding.","That said most botiids require regular contact with conspecifics, a fact exemplied by a number of behavioural rituals which have been recorded consistently in aquaria (see \u2018Notes\u2019)."],"reproduction":"Appears not to have been bred in aquaria. Presumably a seasonal, migratory spawner in nature.","create_time":1426713915.35369}
