Improved information since then has resulted in it being uplisted to Critically Endangered. <br/> <br/>A visit to Joffreville in 2001 revealed that the upper reaches of the Sakaramy River has been effectively de-watered by diversion of the river\u2019s headwaters, for domestic use by local residents. This last riverine subpopulation of <em>P. sakaramyi</em> exists only as a few fish surviving in puddles fed by the leaking water pipe. This species is reputed to occur in Lac Texier and one other low altitude crater lake, both of which are located inside the boundaries of  Montagne d\u2019Ambre National Park. However, these habitats have not been sampled since the late 1950\u2019s and nothing is known of the current status of these populations. In light of these observations this species is assessed as Critically Endangered.","assessor":"Loiselle, P. & participants of the CBSG/ANGAP CAMP \"Faune de Madagascar\" workshop, Mantasoa, Madagascar 2001","evaluator":"Stiassny, M.L.J., Sparks, J.S.
