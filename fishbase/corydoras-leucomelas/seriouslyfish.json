{"images":[],"distribution":"Type locality is \u2018Yarinacocha, cutoff lake at right bank of R\u00edo Pacaya, near Sarayacu, about 5\u00b015\u2019S, 74\u00b015\u2019W, Upper Amazon, Peru\u2019.","habitat":"Mainly inhabits blackwater rivers and tributaries. The water in these biotopes is often stained brown with tannins and other chemicals released from decaying organic material, and is very acidic as a result. C. leucomelas can be found schooling in very large numbers over soft, often muddy substrates.","maintenance":["Ideally use a substrate of fine sand, although rounded gravel is an acceptable alternative provided it\u2019s kept scrupulously clean.","Other d\u00e9cor is largely down to personal choice, but some cover should be provided to give the fish security."],"diet":["Corydoras\u00a0spp. are foraging omnivores, and most will accept sinking dried foods as well as small live and frozen varieties such as chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex, etc.","Feeding a varied diet will ensure\u00a0the fish are in optimum condition.","Under no circumstances should they be expected to survive on \u2018left-overs\u2019 from other inhabitants of the aquarium or relied on to \u2018clean\u2019 the aquarium."],"behaviour":"Peaceful and gregarious. Should be maintained in a group of at least 4-6 individuals.","reproduction":["Can be bred in a similar fashion to many other\u00a0Corydoras\u00a0species.","Use a ratio of two or more males per female if possible, and when the females are visibly full of eggs perform a large (50-70%) water change with cooler water, and increase\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0and flow in the\u00a0tank. Repeat this daily until the fish\u00a0spawn.","Eggs may be deposited on the aquarium glass, among fine-leaved vegetation or within sunken spawning mops, with the latter particularly recommended since they facilitate easy removal of eggs.","Once spawning is complete either adults or eggs should be removed; the latter\u00a0can usually be rolled gently up the glass with a finger. The new container should contain the same water as the\u00a0spawning\u00a0tank\u00a0and be similarly well-oxygenated.","Most breeders add a few drops of methylene blue, or an alder cone or two at this point in order to prevent the eggs developing fungus.","Incubation is normally 3-4 days and once the\u00a0fry\u00a0have fully-absorbed their\u00a0yolk\u00a0sacs they are able to accept small live foods such as\u00a0microworm,\u00a0Artemia\u00a0nauplii, etc.","They are not the easiest to raise, requiring excellent water quality, but seem less susceptible to ailments when maintained over a thin layer of\u00a0sand\u00a0rather than in a bare arrangement."],"create_time":1426711231.9995}
