The most appropriate tankmates include African tetras, dwarf cichlids such as Pelvivachromis or Anomalochromis and small mormyrids. It should not be kept with aggressive or very vigorous fish as it is quite shy. It will not fight with conspecifics and can be kept in groups with no problems."],"reproduction":["","Unrecorded in aquaria."],"create_time":1426712707.74448}
