Artificial plants could be used as an alternative as some of the fabric and silk-type plants that are now available make convincing fakes. Dim lighting and areas of refuge will boost their confidence. A tight-fitting lid is a good idea as these fish move extremely quickly when startled and may launch themselves out of the tank."],"diet":["","Mainly herbivorous. Provide a large amount of vegetable matter in the diet, including; courgette, cucumber, peas, spring greens and other green vegetables. Commercial foods such as algae wafers, spirulina and vegetable flake are also recommended. Silver dollars will also accept the majority of aquarium foods and will relish such treats as bloodworm and brineshrimp."],"behaviour":["","Best kept in groups of at least five fish. Generally peaceful community fish and can be kept with other larger peaceful species. Much smaller fish may be eaten. Myleus mainly occupy the middle and top areas of the aquarium, so it is a good idea to select tankmates that occupy both the bottom of the tank to add contrast. Larger peaceful catfish such as plecos and doradids would be a good choice."],"reproduction":["","No reports of breeding in the hobby."],"create_time":1426712759.6699}
