Alder cones may also be used for the latter purpose.","Fairly dim lighting is recommended and aquatic plant species that can survive under such conditions such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Taxiphyllum\u00a0or\u00a0Cryptocoryne\u00a0spp. may be added, while floating vegetation, especially\u00a0Ceratopteris\u00a0spp., is also useful.","There is no need to use peat, the collection of which is both unsustainable and environmentally-destructive.","Filtration need not be too strong, with an air-powered\u00a0sponge filter\u00a0or similar adequate.","It goes without saying that these are fishes are sensitive to fluctuating organic wastes and should never be introduced to biologically-immature aquaria.","This species is less fussy than many congeners in terms of water chemistry though soft, slightly acidic conditions are preferable."],"diet":["Apistogramma spp. are chiefly carnivorous and feed mostly on benthic invertebrates in nature.","In the aquarium live and frozen foods such as Artemia, Daphnia, Moina and chironomid larvae (bloodworm) should be offered regularly although most species will also learn to accept dried alternatives with pelleted products generally preferred to flake."],"behaviour":["Captive-raised fish are the recommended choice for the\u00a0community aquarium.","Wild examples are best maintained alone or with small \u2018dither\u2019 fishes such as\u00a0Nannostomus\u00a0spp., and ideally should not be mixed with other\u00a0Apistogramma."],"reproduction":["Substrate\u00a0spawner which normally lays its eggs in crevices or cavities among the d\u00e9cor.","Sexually-mature males establish territories and react aggressively to other males in the vicinity, though the presence of several females is normally tolerated.","Post-spawning the male usually returns to protecting his larger territory and courting other females leaving the female to guard and tend the eggs and fry, although when maintained as a single pair he may help guard the fry once mobile.","Depending on temperature the eggs hatch in 36-72 hours with the fry free-swimming after a further few days."],"create_time":1426710245.51268}
