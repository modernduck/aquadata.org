Simulate the Deep Angel\u2019s habitat too, with bits of wood (mopani, driftwood, bogwood \u2013 specifically roots) as overhanging branches. Provide a soft substrate (either sand or a fine gravel) as Altums may dig. Make sure there isn\u2019t a great amount of water flow in the aquarium as Altum Angels specifically enjoy very slow flowing rivers."],"diet":["","As most Altum Angels are wild caught, feeding can be troublesome. Prepare to give live foods to these fish on a regular basis. Even then, wild caught Altum Angels may not accept the food. For some reason they are more likely to go for regurgitated/waste food from other fish \u2013 Discus being the prime example. Once settled and feeding on live, they can be weened onto frozen food by mixing it with the live food at feeding time. Tank bred Pterophyllum Altum may well accept any food, including flake."],"behaviour":["","As with their more common relatives (Angelfish \u2013 Pterophyllum Scalare), anything which can fit in the Altum\u2019s mouth is \u201cfair game\u201d. This includes Neon Tetras, Guppies, Pygmy Rasboras and the likes. Be careful with respect to smaller fish in an Angel\u2019s aquarium, though they are fine with other peaceful, larger fish."],"reproduction":["","Breeding can be very difficult with Altums. Contrary to many profiles on the Internet, Altums have been bred in captivity without artificially raising the fry. Very acidic, soft water is required to breed Altums. Growing up a group of 6 young Altum generally has a good change of finding a breeding pair. Once the pair have bonded, spawning may begin. If you find that the spawns are being eaten by the parents, you may have to artifically raise the fry in a small tank. If this is the case, assist the fry by placing 8 drops of methylene blue for every 5 gallons of water in the fry-raising tank. After the fry become free swimming, start to replace some of the water in the fry-raising tank with RO water."],"create_time":1426713533.65425}
