This can be further furnished with driftwood roots or branches, and hardy\u00a0aquatic\u00a0plants.","Most importantly, the water must be clean and well-oxygenated with turnover preferably\u00a0in excess of 10 times per hour; additional powerheads and airstones can be employed to achieve the desired flow and\u00a0oxygenation\u00a0if necessary. Bright lighting will promote development\u00a0of\u00a0biofilm\u00a0on solid surfaces, upon which the fish will\u00a0graze.","Since it needs stable water conditions and grazes\u00a0biofilm\u00a0this species should never be added to a biologically immature set-up, and a tightly-fitting cover is necessary since it can literally climb glass."],"diet":["Although it will\u00a0graze\u00a0algae\u00a0if available this\u00a0species\u00a0is not an exclusive\u00a0herbivore. Offer meaty foods such as live or frozen chironomid larvae (bloodworm),\u00a0Tubifex,\u00a0Artemia, chopped prawn, etc., along with good quality, sinking dried products, at least some of which should contain a significant proportion of vegetable matter such as\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar.","Fresh fruit and vegetables such as cucumber, melon, blanched spinach or courgette can be offered occasionally and home-made, gelatine-bound recipes containing a mixture of dried fish food, pur\u00e9ed shellfish, fresh fruit and vegetables, are also proven to work well."],"behaviour":["Relatively peaceful and can be maintained alongside other species which require similar environmental conditions.","It isn\u2019t particularly tolerant of conspecifics in small aquaria, but exists in loose aggregations in the wild. If kept singly it tends to behave more aggressively with similarly-shaped fishes so we recommend the purchase of 3-4 or more should space permit. Such a group will develop a noticeable\u00a0pecking order\u00a0between themselves, but tankmates are more likely to be left alone."],"reproduction":["Large numbers of fish traded as Garra rufa are produced\u00a0in several countries, but it is unclear exactly which populations, and therefore species, are involved (see \u2018Notes\u2019). It is also uncertain if these are bred naturally or via artificial stimulation with hormones.","Wild populations tend to spawn continuously over a prolonged period, typically between April\u00a0and November. Eggs are scattered over gravel or rocks and the adults do not exhibit parental care."],"create_time":1426711777.63962}
