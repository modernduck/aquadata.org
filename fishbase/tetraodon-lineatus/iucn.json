It is therefore listed as Least Concern. It has also been assessed regionally as Least Concern for eastern, north eastern and western Africa. In northern Africa, it has been classed as 'Endangered' by Bishai and Khalil (1997) in Lower and Upper Egyptian Nile. The species EOO is more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and the AOO is more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. However it is suspected that the species may be extirpated from below the dam, as it is no longer caught in the fishery catches (Kraiem, pers. comm.) so more information is needed on its current status before a full assessment can be made. It is therefore categorized as Data Deficient.","assessor":"Akinyi, E., Azeroual, A., Bousso, T., Getahun, A. & Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P.","evaluator":"Snoeks, J., Tweddle, D., Getahun, A., Lal\u00e8y\u00e8, P., Paugy, D., Zaiss, R., Fishar, M.R.A & Brooks, E."}]
