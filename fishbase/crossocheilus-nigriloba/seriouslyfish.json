It occurs throughout the Kapuas basin in the western province of Kalimantan Barat, including the Danau Sentarum lake system, and the Belayan and Mahakam Rivers in eastern Kalimantan Timur province.","Presumably it can also be found in drainages of Kalimantan Tengah and Kalimantan Selatan provinces, but we\u2019ve been unable to obtain any details to date.","Type locality is \u2018Bo River, central Borneo\u2019."],"habitat":["Crossocheilus species inhabit flowing streams and tributaries with substrates of boulders, pebbles, gravel and sand, often in areas with submerged driftwood or tree roots. The clear, often shallow, water allows sunlight to penetrate the surface and the development of a rich biofilm covering submerged surfaces upon which the fish browse.","They are thought to undergo seasonal migrations during which they can be found in deeper, more turbid water."],"maintenance":["This\u00a0species\u00a0will do well in most well-maintained tanks but we highly recommend keeping it in a set-up designed to resemble a flowing\u00a0river\u00a0or stream, with a\u00a0substrate\u00a0of variably-sized rocks,\u00a0gravel\u00a0and some large water-worn boulders.","It can be further furnished with driftwood branches arranged to form a network of nooks, crannies and shaded spots. While the majority of plant\u00a0species\u00a0will fail to thrive in such surroundings hardy types such as\u00a0Microsorum,\u00a0Bolbitis\u00a0or\u00a0Anubias\u00a0spp. can be grown attached to the d\u00e9cor and bright lighting will promote the growth of\u00a0algae\u00a0upon which the fish will\u00a0graze. In this kind of environment it will display more natural behaviour and can be kept alongside other\u00a0species\u00a0that enjoy similar conditions.","Like many fishes that naturally inhabit running waters it\u2019s intolerant to the accumulation of\u00a0organic\u00a0wastes and requires spotless water at all times in order to thrive. It also does best if there is a high level of\u00a0dissolved oxygen\u00a0and a decent level of water movement in the\u00a0tank\u00a0so\u00a0external filters, powerheads or similar should be employed in order to obtain the desired effect."],"diet":["\u2018Crossocheilus siamensis\u2019 (see \u2018Notes\u2019) is famed as a consumer of \u2018black brush\u2019\u00a0algae\u00a0(BBA), also known as \u2018red\u2019 or \u2018beard\u2019\u00a0algae. These members of the Division\u00a0Rhodophyta\u00a0can be otherwise difficult to remove once established in aquaria so the \u2018species\u2019 has achieved huge popularity among hobbyists who maintain planted set-ups.","Presumably this saleability is also one reason why several fishes, including\u00a0C. nigriloba, are offered under the name. These do browse on BBA but to varying extents depending on\u00a0species\u00a0and in some cases the availability of alternative food sources.\u00a0C. atrilimes, for example, shows a preference for fine-leaved, higher plants such as\u00a0Vesicularia\u00a0spp. but will also feed on various types of\u00a0algae.\u00a0C. langei\u00a0sensu\u00a0amplo is the most efficient consumer of BBA although some reports state that only younger, softer growths are eaten and that the fish should be introduced prior to any potential outbreak.","In nature\u00a0Crossocheilus\u00a0species\u00a0are\u00a0aufwuchs\u00a0grazers feeding on\u00a0algae,\u00a0diatoms\u00a0and other\u00a0phytoplankton, plus associated microorganisms. The use of high-protein foods in the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0should therefore be avoided as the fish are unable to metabolise some components efficiently; regular, prolonged consumption can result in excessive deposits of fat and even organ degeneration.","A good quality dried product(s) with added\u00a0Spirulina\u00a0or similar is ideal but plenty of fresh vegetable matter should also be included in the diet. Shelled peas, blanched courgette, spinach and chopped fruit all make good additions to the menu. Once settled into the\u00a0aquarium\u00a0the fish sometimes ascend into midwater to feed and in a set-up as described above will often be seen browsing the\u00a0biofilm\u00a0that tends to form on the rockwork."],"behaviour":["Generally peaceful and can be maintained alongside many of the more popular species in the hobby although our preference would be to select fishes from from one of its native countries or rivers. In the exceptionally diverse Danau Sentarum sympatric species include Barbonymus gonionotus, B. schwanenfeldii, Cyclocheilichthys apogon, C. janthochir, C. repasson, Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus, Labiobarbus ocellatus, Luciosoma\u00a0spp., and various smaller cyprinids.","Crossocheilus\u00a0spp. are typically found swimming in loose aggregations in nature and can exhibit shy or skittish behaviour if kept singly or in small numbers. They are shoaling, rather than\u00a0schooling, fishes which develop a distinct\u00a0pecking order\u00a0and are best-maintained in a group of six or more since weaker individuals may be bullied incessantly if smaller numbers are kept. You\u2019ll be rewarded with a more natural-looking display plus interesting behaviour from the fish as they interact with one another."],"reproduction":"Not thought to have occured in the hobby and as far as we know it\u2019s not being farmed for the trade although related species are induced to spawn artificially via the use of hormones. Members of this genus are known to undergo seasonal reproductive migrations in nature, moving upstream during the dryer months and in the opposite direction when water levels rise.","create_time":1426711426.74935}
