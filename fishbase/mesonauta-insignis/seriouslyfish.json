Once the breeding area is prepared, eggs will be deposited by the female and then fertilised by the male. In excess of 200 eggs may be laid. Both fish guard the eggs and when the fry hatch two to three days later, they are transferred to a pit where the parents keep them until they become free-swimming. This is usually 3 \u2013 4 days after hatching. Both fish assume parental duties but can be easily spooked often leading to them eating the fry. It is advisable that the breeding tank be placed in a quiet location and distrubed as little as possible. ","Fry can be fed on newly-hatched brineshrimp and powdered fry foods until large enough to take bigger foods."],"create_time":1426712672.14126}
