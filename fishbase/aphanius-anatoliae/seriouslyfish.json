It has also been recorded from various rivers, pools and swamps between the cities of Konya and Ni\u00c4\u0178de and further west from springs of the B\u00c3\u00bcy\u00c3\u00bck Menderes drainage and within the area of coastal wetland formed by the river\u2018s lower reaches in the Sel\u00c3\u00a7uk plain.","\u00a0Populations from Lake \u00c3\u2021avu\u00c5\u0178\u00c3\u00a7u and the upper Sakarya river basin that had also been considered closely-related to A. danfordii were elevated to species status in 2003 and are now classified as A. villwocki.","\nUnfortunately the species is not as widespread as it once was. Around Lake Tuz several populations have disappeared or are considered at risk due to pollution or removal of water for agriculture and it has already been extirpated from Lakes Ak, Yar\u00c4\u00b1\u00c5\u0178l\u00c4\u00b1, G\u00c3\u00b6lhisar and S\u00c3\u00b6\u00c4\u0178\u00c3\u00bct. In 1996 one relict population was discovered inhabiting irrigation canals at the northern end of the S\u00c3\u00b6\u00c4\u0178\u00c3\u00bct plain. The introduction of predatory species to Lakes E\u00c4\u0178irdir and Bey\u00c5\u0178ehir has resulted in a serious decline of the numbers recorded. In the north and northeast of the Konya steppe it now occurs sympatrically with A. mento due to the construction of a number of agricultural canals in the area but potential effects of this overlap, such as hybridisation, have not yet been studied. See the \u2018notes\u2018 section for a little more on the distribution of Aphanius in Anatolia.","It is quite variable across its range with body and fin colouration often being indicative of locality. The different forms are often labelled with the collection details by aquarists and scientists in order to preserve bloodlines and maintain accuracy e.g. \u2018E\u00c4\u0178irdir\u2018, \u2018Bey\u00c5\u0178ehir\u2018, \u2018I\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1kl\u00c4\u00b1\u2019 etc.",""],"habitat":["","This species is found living in various habitat-types depending on the locality with some populations existing in slightly brackish conditions and others in pure freshwater. For example Lake Tuz is a shallow, seasonal, hyper-saline lake located to the southeast of Ankara and in hotter months becomes almost completely dry exposing a residual salt layer up to 30cm thick. The fish are unable to survive in the main body of the lake and are restricted to surrounding, mildly saline waters.\u00a0","E\u00c4\u0178irdir and Bey\u00c5\u0178ehir are freshwater systems and while A. anatoliae can be found in the lakes themselves it tends to be restricted to reedy marginal zones due to the presence of predatory species both native and introduced. In other areas it has been observed in swamps, pools, smaller rivers and streams, usually where filamentous algae or submerged/marginal vegetation grows thickly.",""],"maintenance":["","Even for long-term maintenance a simple set-up will suffice. The most important factors are the provision of many broken lines of sight and a suitable medium in which the fish can deposit eggs. Female and subdominant male individuals must be offered the opportunity of respite from the aggressive alpha males during the spawning season so much of the available space can be filled with acrylic wool mops (use a fine grade if available), clumps of java moss/other fine-leaved plant and ideally filamentous algae.\u00a0","There\u2018s no need to add a substrate although inert sand or gravel can be added if you prefer. Filtration need not be too strong and this species certainly does not require running water as suggested by some sources. It is possible, and preferable, to maintain it outdoors all year round in many countries and it will show better colours and overall condition if exposed to at least a few hours of natural sunlight each day.",""],"diet":["","Aphanius species are basically micropredators feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton although algae and other plant material is also taken at times. In the aquarium they will learn to accept dried foods in most cases but should also be offered regular meals of small live or frozen fare such as Artemia, Daphnia or bloodworm. This is particularly important during the months of spring and summer due to their high reproductive effort throughout this period. If the aquarium or container does not contain filamentous algae try to introduce a good quality dried product with added Spirulina content to the diet.",""],"behaviour":["","Its particular water requirements and aggressive spawning behaviour make A. anatoliae a poor choice for the community aquarium. Given its precarious conservation status the emphasis should also be on captive reproduction and we strongly recommend maintaining it alone. It should be kept in a group with a ratio of two or three females to each male being the ideal.",""],"reproduction":["","Captive reproduction is not difficult if the tank or container is properly arranged and maintained (see \u2018tank set-up\u2018). It is a fractional spawner with females depositing eggs on a more-or-less continuous basis between the months of April and September. Males form temporary territories which they defend against rivals while attempting to entice females to spawn. Dominant individuals will show more intense colouration. Eggs are released singly or in small batches and are attached to algae or other surfaces by means of small filaments. Aphanius typically eat their eggs/fry and the medium should therefore be checked on a daily basis during the spawning period. ","The eggs are very small and must be treated carefully. Use a fine pair of forceps to gently remove pieces of medium with eggs attached whilst avoiding contact with the eggs themselves. Alternatively the entire medium can be removed and replaced every couple of days. The medium/eggs should be transferred to a container with water of the same chemistry and temperature as that of the adults. The incubation period can vary a little with the temperature but is usually between 7 -14 days with the fry being large enough to accept Artemia nauplii, microworm etc. immediately after they become free-swimming.",""],"create_time":1426710128.23706}
