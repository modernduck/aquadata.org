Conclusive molecular data strongly support the view, that they represent other species. These populations are therefore excluded from the assessment.","rationale":"This species is widespread in Turkey. It is known from freshwater springs and streams around Lake Tuz, and several streams, springs and marshes around Konya and eastward to Nigde. It also occurs in spring Eflatun P\u0131nar\u0131 in Lake Bey\u015fehir basin. However, most populations are believed to have declined due to water abstraction and the desiccation of small streams. It is suspected to have declined by almost 30% in the past 10 years, as the species has lost some huge subpopulations (such as the one from Lake B\u00fcget). It is assessed as Near Threatened as it is close to meeting Vulnerable under criterion A2.","assessor":"Freyhof, J.","evaluator":"Ekmek\u00e7i, F. & Smith, K."}]
